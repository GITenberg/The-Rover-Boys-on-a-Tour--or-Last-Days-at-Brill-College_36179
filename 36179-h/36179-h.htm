<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Boys:</span> This book is a complete
story in itself, but forms the twentieth volume
in a line issued under the general title, "The
Rover Boys Series for Young Americans."</p>

<p>As I have mentioned in other volumes, this
line was started a number of years ago with
the publication of "The Rover Boys at School,"
"On the Ocean," and "In the Jungle." These
stories were so well received that there was an
immediate cry for more, and so, year by year,
they were followed by the publication of "The
Rover Boys Out West," "On the Great Lakes,"
"In the Mountains," "In Camp," "On Land and
Sea," "On the River," "On the Plains," "In
Southern Waters," "On the Farm," "On Treasure
Isle," "At College," "Down East," "In the
Air," "In New York," "In Alaska," and finally,
"In Business," where we last left our heroes.</p>

<p>The Rover boys have, of course, gradually
been growing older. Dick and Tom are both
married and doing what they can to carry on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
their father's business in New York City. Sam,
the youngest of the boys, is still at Brill College.
The particulars are given of some winter sports
around that institution of learning, and then of
a great baseball game in which the youngest
Rover distinguishes himself. Then Sam graduates
from college, and all the boys, with some
others, go on a long automobile tour, during
which a number of exciting adventures occur.
The party is caught in a storm on the mountains,
and later on are caught in a great flood.
What the Rover boys did under such trying
circumstances I leave for the pages which follow
to disclose.</p>

<p>Once more I wish to thank all my young
friends for the many gratifying things they have
said about my books. I trust that the present
volume will fulfil all their expectations, and that
the reading of the same will do them good.</p>

<p>Affectionately and sincerely yours,</p>

<h3>THE SNOWBALL FIGHT</h3>


<p>"Now then, boys, are you ready?"</p>

<p>"I am!"</p>

<p>"Been ready for the last five minutes!"</p>

<p>"Sure you've got all the snowballs you can
carry?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't carry any more if I tried," came
from Sam Rover, with a grin. "Just see how I
am loaded up," and he glanced down at both
hands, which were filled with snowballs, and
at the snowballs held under either arm.</p>

<p>"I've got some dandy hard ones," put in Spud
Jackson.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't use soakers, Spud!" cried Stanley
Browne, who was the leader of the snowballing
contingent. "That's against the rules."</p>

<p>"They are not soakers, Stanley," was the reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
"They are only good and hard, that's all."</p>

<p>"Hi, you fellows! When are you going to
start things?" came a cry from behind a snow
wall up the slope of a hill. "We can't waste the
whole afternoon waiting for you."</p>

<p>"We're coming, don't fear," answered Stanley
Browne.</p>

<p>"And when we arrive you won't know what's
struck you," announced Sam Rover gaily.</p>

<p>"It's all vell enough to brag, but you'd chust
better start dot fight," came in German-American
accents from behind the snow wall, and a
merry face appeared in sight for an instant and
a fist was shaken playfully at those beyond.</p>

<p>"Sound that bugle, Paul!" yelled the leader of
the attacking party, and an instant later the mellow
notes of a bugle floated out on the crisp,
wintry air.</p>

<p>It was the signal for the attack, and with merry
shouts the students at the foot of the hill charged
upward through the snow toward the wall above.</p>

<p>The occasion was the annual snowball fight
at Brill College. Snow fights there were, of
course, without number, but each year there was
one big contest in which the freshmen and
sophomores attempted to hold a snow fort located
on the hill back of the institution against
the attacks of the juniors and seniors. According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to the rules, three charges were allowable,
all of which must be made inside of two hours,
and if all of these failed to take the fort, then
the victory went to the defenders, and they
were permitted to crow over their success until
the following winter.</p>

<p>A little over an hour and a half had been spent
in the sport and two attacks had been made and
repulsed, much to the chagrin of Stanley Browne,
the senior in charge of the attacking army. Juniors
and seniors had fought nobly, but the freshmen
and sophomores outnumbered them, and,
being strongly intrenched behind the snow wall
of the so-called fort, had succeeded in forcing
a first, and then a second, retreat.</p>

<p>"Say, fellows, we've got to do it this time,
sure!" cried Sam Rover, as, side by side with
Stanley, he led the attack. "If we don't oust
them they'll never get done talking about it."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Sam!" answered Bob Grimes,
who also had hands and arms full of well-made
snowballs.</p>

<p>"Remember what I told you," came from Stanley,
as he turned slightly to address his followers.
"Don't throw any snowballs yet. Do as
the soldiers did in Revolutionary days&mdash;wait until
you can see the whites of their eyes."</p>

<p>"And then make those whites blacks!" burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
out Spud Jackson, gaily. "Come ahead, and no
turning back."</p>

<p>Up the snowy hillside sped the crowd of students,
while a number of professors and visitors
watched the advance from a distance.</p>

<p>"Get ready for 'em! Don't let them come too
near!" came in a rallying cry from behind the
snow wall. And then, as the attacking party
came closer, a volley of white spheres came flying
through the air into the faces of the juniors
and seniors.</p>

<p>It was a sharp and heavy volley, and for the
instant the air seemed to be filled with flying
snowballs. Many of them, of course, went wild,
but others landed on the heads and bodies of the
attacking party, and for the moment the advance
was checked.</p>

<p>"Wow!" came from one of the juniors who
had been hit in the ear. "Why can't we do some
throwing ourselves?"</p>

<p>"That's the talk! Give it to 'em!" came from
another student who had had his cap knocked
off by a snowball.</p>

<p>"No, no," answered Stanley. "Save your
snowballs until we get closer."</p>

<p>"Come on, we'll soon be up there," put in Sam
Rover. "Only a hundred feet more, fellows!"</p>

<p>There was a yell of assent, and forward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
charging party went again in the face of another
volley of snowballs. By bending low the
juniors and seniors protected themselves as
much as possible from the onslaught, but many
were hit, two so stingingly that they had to retire
to the rear.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! We've got 'em on the run!" came
from the leader of the fort contingent, who
had mounted a tree stump located behind the wall.
"Give it to 'em, fellows! Give it too 'em hot!"</p>

<p>"Now, then, boys, all together!" yelled Stanley
at the top of his voice, and then the eager
juniors and seniors launched their snowballs
with all the swiftness and accuracy of aim at
their command.</p>

<p>The two previous attacks which had been repulsed
had taught the advancing students a lesson,
and now in this third attack scarcely a snowball
was wasted. Those in the front ran directly
up to the wall of the fort, while those farther
back spread out, as directed by their leader, to
the right and to the left, sending in cross fires
at points where the fort was supposed to be
weakest.</p>

<p>It was a thrilling and spirited fight, but, although
the students were greatly excited, there
was little more actual roughness than there would
have been at a football or other athletic contest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Over the wall, boys! Over the wall!" burst
out Sam Rover, and the next instant he was up
on the wall of the fort, quickly followed by Stanley,
Bob, Spud, and several others.</p>

<p>"Back there, you rebels! Back!" came in a yell
from the interior of the fort, and then a wild
fusillade of snowballs struck Sam and his chums
in various parts of their bodies.</p>

<p>"Jumping hambones!" spluttered Spud, as a
snowball took him directly in the chin. "What
do you think I'm built of, iron?"</p>

<p>"Get back or you'll get worse!" was the cry
from the fort, and then another snowball took
Spud in the ear.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Sam Rover had dodged a
ball which was coming directly for his face, and
now he returned the fire with a hard one that
took the sophomore below him in the ear. Then
Sam jumped down into the fort, quickly followed
by eight or ten others.</p>

<p>"Clear them out! Don't let them stay here!"
was the wild cry.</p>

<p>"Everybody around the flagpole!" was the
command of the fort leader.</p>

<p>The flagpole was a small one located in the
center of the enclosure, and from it fluttered the
banners of the freshmen and the sophomore
classes. Those making the attack would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
to haul those banners down before they could
claim a victory.</p>

<p>Snowballs were now flying in all directions,
and it was quite probable that in the excitement
many of the students let fly at their friends instead
of at the enemy; but it was all good, clean
sport, and everybody enjoyed it greatly.</p>

<p>"Now, then, fellows, for a center rush!" came
from Stanley, when he and Sam and about
twenty others had forced their way to within
ten yards of the flagpole.</p>

<p>"Avalanche them, boys! Avalanche them!"
came suddenly from one of the sophomores, and
then without warning huge chunks of loose snow
were sent flying through the air on the heads
of those who were battling to get to the flagpole.</p>

<p>"Great Cæsar's ghost!" spluttered Bob, as
some of the snow went down inside his collar.
"What is this; a snowslide?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't mind a little thing like that,"
answered Sam Rover. "Come ahead, everybody!
Push!"</p>

<p>There was a wild scramble, with many yells
and shouts. Student after student went down
in the mêlée, a few to be trampled upon, but
fortunately nobody was seriously hurt. There
was such a congestion that to make or throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
more snowballs was out of the question, and
the most a fighter could do was to snatch up a
handful of loose snow and thrust it down the
neck of the student opposing him. Sam and
Stanley, with four others close by them, had
now managed to get within a few feet of the
flagpole. Here, however, the freshmen and
sophomores had planted themselves in a solid
mass, and it looked for the moment as if nothing
could budge them.</p>

<p>"Only six minutes more, boys! Only six minutes
more!" came from one of the sophomores
who had been detailed as a timekeeper. "Save
those banners for six minutes and we'll win."</p>

<p>"Hit 'em, fellows, hit 'em!" roared Stanley.
"We've got to get those banners this year."</p>

<p>"And we're going to do it," added Sam. He
turned to Bob and Spud. "Boost me up, fellows,
and I'll walk right over their heads to the
pole."</p>

<p>"All right, if you want to take the chance,"
answered Spud, and in a twinkling Sam was
shoved up into the air onto the shoulders of
the boy in front of him.</p>

<p>This student let out a cry of alarm, but before
he could do anything Sam made a leap
forward, landing on the shoulders of two students
close to the pole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fire him back! Don't let him reach the
pole!" came in a yell from several throats.</p>

<p>"Hold him by the ankles! Don't let him
jump!" cried out the leader of the fort defenders.</p>

<p>Several students turned to clutch at the ankles
of Sam Rover, but he was too nimble for them,
and with another leap he reached the flagpole
and clutched it tightly.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Rover has reached the pole!"</p>

<p>"Get those banners, Sam! There is no time to
spare!"</p>

<p>"Hold him!" "Pull him down!" "Maul him!"
cried the fort defenders. "Don't let him climb
up the pole!"</p>

<p>Several turned to clutch at Sam's legs and
feet, but he thrashed out wildly and all but one
fell back, fearing injury. The undaunted student
caught Sam by a heel and held on very much
as might a bulldog.</p>

<p>"Let go there," came from Spud, and the next
instant he raised a chunk of snow and shoved it
directly into the open mouth of the boy who
had the grip. This was too much for the student,
and he fell back among his fellows.</p>

<p>"Only two minutes more!" yelled the timekeeper.
"Two minutes more!"</p>

<p>"We won't need more than fifteen seconds,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
came triumphantly from Sam, and as he spoke
he commenced to climb the pole.</p>

<p>A sophomore followed, clutching again at one
of his feet, but now the Rover boy had his hand
on the first of the banners, and down it came
in a twinkling, and the second quickly followed.</p>

<p>"Here you are, boys; catch them!" Sam cried
and, wadding the banners into something of a
ball, he hurled them out into the midst of a group
of seniors.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! we've got 'em!" was the triumphant
cry. "We've got 'em!"</p>

<p>"Time's up!" yelled the timekeeper.</p>

<p>A cheer arose from the juniors and seniors,
who quickly held the captured banners aloft.
The freshmen and sophomores were, of course,
keenly disappointed, and a number of them
showed it.</p>

<p>"Let's drive them out of the fort, anyway!"
was the sudden cry. "Give it to 'em! Send 'em
flying!"</p>

<p>"Wait, wait, this contest is at an end," said
a professor who was one of the umpires.</p>

<p>"Never mind, let's have some fun anyway."
This cry was taken up on every side, and while
some of the seniors retired with the two captured
banners, the other students continued the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
contest, those who had held the fort doing all
they possibly could to overcome and expel their
enemies.</p>

<p>As soon as he had thrown the banners Sam
slid down the pole, and was now trying his best
to make his way out of the crowd of freshmen
and sophomores. These students were very
bitter against the Rover boy, and several did all
they could to trip him up and cover him with
snow.</p>

<p>"Say, Sam, that was great!" cried Spud. "Best
I ever saw!"</p>

<p>"Out with 'em! Out with 'em!" was the yell.
"Don't let 'em stay in the fort even if they did
get the banners."</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Sam quickly. "Now we
have the banners let us drive them clean down
the other side of the hill."</p>

<p>This suggestion received instant approval
and, in spite of all that some of the professors
could do to stop it, the fight went on as furiously
as ever. Some of the students who had
retreated to a safe distance came back with a
fresh supply of snowballs, and the air was once
more filled with the flying missiles.</p>

<p>"Come on, let us teach them a lesson," cried
Bob Grimes. "They should have stopped fighting
as soon as the banners were captured. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
us give the sophomores and freshmen all they
want."</p>

<p>This cry was taken up on all sides, and around
and around the enclosure which had been designated
the fort went the various crowds of students.
The blood of the juniors and seniors
was now up, and slowly but surely they forced
the younger students to retreat. Then came a
break and something of a panic, and a few minutes
later the fort defenders were retreating
down the other side of the hill, which led through
some brushwood to a road that ran to Ashton.</p>

<p>"After 'em! After 'em! Don't let 'em get
away!" cried Sam, and was one of the first to
go down the hill after the retreating students.
On the way he paused only long enough to make
several snowballs.</p>

<p>Having reached the road which led to the
town, the freshmen and sophomores divided,
some going behind a barn and others taking to
the woods beyond. Not knowing exactly what
to do next, Sam and several with him halted to
consider the matter.</p>

<p>"There they go!" was the cry a moment later,
and a number of students were seen speeding
around a corner of the road.</p>

<p>"That's Bissel, the fellow who hit me in the
ear," cried Sam. "I'm going after him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"And, yes, there is Dutz, who filled my mouth
with snow," cried Spud. "Come on!"</p>

<p>Sam was already on the run, and, coming to
the turn in the road, he let fly several snowballs.</p>

<p>"Here! Here! What do you mean by such
actions?" came suddenly from behind some
brushwood which lined the roadway and then,
as the students advanced still further, they were
surprised to find themselves confronted by a tall
man wearing a heavy, fur-lined overcoat. He
had likewise been wearing a beaver hat, but
the tile now lay in the snow.</p>

<p>"Belright Fogg!" exclaimed Sam in dismay.
"That lawyer who tried to get the best of us!
And I thought he was one of the students!"</p>

<p>"Ha! so it is you," snarled the man in the fur
overcoat harshly. "What do you mean, Rover,
by attacking me in this fashion?"</p>

<h3>SOMETHING ABOUT THE ROVER BOYS</h3>


<p>"Say! that isn't one of the students."</p>

<p>"Not much! Why, that's the lawyer who used
to do business for the railroad company&mdash;the
man the Rovers had so much trouble with!"</p>

<p>"Who knocked his hat off?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;Sam Rover, I guess."</p>

<p>Such were some of the remarks made as a
number of the juniors and seniors began to congregate
around Sam and Mr. Belright Fogg. All
of the students could readily see that the lawyer
was very much put out over what had occurred.</p>

<p>"I say, Rover, what do you mean by attacking
me in this fashion?" repeated Belright Fogg,
with a savage look at the youth before him.</p>

<p>"If I knocked your hat off, Mr. Fogg, I am
sorry for it," answered Sam, as soon as he could
recover from his surprise.</p>

<p>"Knocked my hat off?" roared the lawyer.
"You hit me a hard one on the head; that is what
you did!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me see if you are hurt," put in Stanley,
stepping forward. "Where did the snowball hit
you?"</p>

<p>"You keep your hands off me," returned Belright
Fogg. "I've a good mind to have the law
on such loafers as you."</p>

<p>"We are not loafers, Mr. Fogg," answered
Sam, the color coming quickly to his face. "We
were having our annual snowballing contest, and
we did not know that any outsider was on this
back road. If I hit you and hurt you I am very
sorry for it."</p>

<p>"Humph! I think you will be sorry for it if I
bring a suit for damages," muttered the lawyer.
"I don't know why Dr. Wallington permits such
rowdyism."</p>

<p>"This isn't rowdyism, nor are we loafers," put
in Stanley, somewhat sharply. "You seem to
forget, Mr. Fogg, that this road runs through
the property belonging to Brill College, and we
have a perfect right to hold our snowballing
contest here. If you want to report the matter
to Dr. Wall&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah! I know you students, and I wouldn't
expect any sympathy from your teacher. He's
too afraid of losing any of his students." Belright
Fogg snatched his beaver hat from the
hands of Spud, who had picked it up. "I'll settle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
with you for this later, Rover," he added,
and then turned on his heel and hurried down
the road.</p>

<p>"I wonder what brought him on this back
road on foot?" observed Bob.</p>

<p>"He isn't on foot. He has his horse and cutter
beside the barn," answered another student.
"There he is now, picking up a robe out of the
snow. It must have fallen out of the cutter and
he walked back to get it." Which surmise was
correct.</p>

<p>"This looks like more trouble for me," said
Sam, soberly. "I'm mighty sorry it was Mr. Belright
Fogg I hit with that snowball."</p>

<p>"You can wager he'll make out a case against
you if he possibly can," remarked Spud. "Lawyers
of his calibre always do."</p>

<p>"Well, this settles the snowball fight for us,"
put in Stanley, as he looked up and down the
road. "The freshies and sophs are clear out of
sight. Let us go back to the campus and celebrate
our victory;" and then, as Belright Fogg
drove away in his cutter, the students walked
over the hill in the direction of Brill.</p>

<p>To my old readers the youths already mentioned
in these pages will need no special introduction.
For the benefit of others, however, let
me state that Sam Rover was the youngest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
three brothers, Dick being the eldest and fun-loving
Tom coming next. They were the sons
of one Anderson Rover, a rich widower, and
had for years made their home with their Uncle
Randolph and their Aunt Martha at a beautiful
farm called Valley Brook.</p>

<p>From the farm, and while their father was
in Africa, the three Rover boys had been sent
by their uncle to school, as related in the first
volume of this series, entitled "The Rover Boys
at School." This place was called Putnam Hall
Military Academy, and there the lads made many
friends, and likewise several enemies, and had
"the time of their lives," as Tom Rover often
expressed it.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">*</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">*</span></a> For particulars regarding how Putnam Hall Military
Academy was organized, and what fine times the cadets
there enjoyed even before the Rover boys came on the
scene, read "The Putnam Hall Series," six volumes, starting
with "The Putnam Hall Cadets."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Publishers.</span></p></div>

<p>The first term at school was followed by an
exciting trip on the ocean, and then another
trip into the jungles of Africa, where the boys
went looking for their parent. Then came a trip
to the West, followed by some grand times on
the Great Lakes and in the Mountains. Then
the boys returned to Putnam Hall, to go into an
encampment with their fellow-cadets.</p>

<p>This term at Putnam Hall was followed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
never-to-be-forgotten journey on Land and Sea
to a far-away island in the Pacific. Then they
returned to this country, sailing down the Ohio
and Mississippi rivers. After leaving the
Father of Waters, they took an outing on the
Plains, and then went down into Southern Waters,
where they solved the mystery of a deserted
steam yacht.</p>

<p>After so many exciting adventures the three
brothers had been glad to journey to the home
farm for a rest, after which they returned to
Putnam Hall, settled down to their studies, and
graduated with considerable honor.</p>

<p>"Now for college!" Dick Rover had said. But
before setting out for Brill, a fine institution of
learning located in the Middle West, the boys
had become involved in a search for a fortune
left on Treasure Isle.</p>

<p>During their days at Putnam Hall the Rover
boys had become well acquainted with Dora
Stanhope, who lived near the school with her
widowed mother, and also with Nellie and Grace
Laning, Dora's two cousins, who resided a short
distance farther away. It had not been long before
Dick and Dora showed a great liking for
each other, and at the same time Tom often
paired off with Nellie and Sam was frequently
seen in the company of Grace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>A few miles away from Brill College was located
Hope Seminary, an institution for girls,
and when the Rover boys went to Brill, Dora,
Nellie and Grace went to Hope; so that the
young folks met almost as often as before.</p>

<p>A term at Brill College was followed by an
unexpected trip Down East, where the Rovers
brought to terms a rascally ex-schoolteacher,
named Josiah Crabtree, who had given them
much trouble while at Putnam Hall.</p>

<p>In those days the art of flying was attracting
considerable attention and, through the indulgence
of their father, the Rover boys became
the possessors of a biplane and took several
thrilling trips through the air, their experiences
in that line coming to an abrupt finish when
the flying machine was one day wrecked on the
railroad tracks. This had brought on a sharp
contest between the Rover boys and the railroad
lawyer, Mr. Belright Fogg. The Rovers had
claimed all that was coming to them, and the
railroad had been made to pay up, much to Belright
Fogg's disgust. Later, the lawyer had been
discharged by the railroad from its services.</p>

<p>About this time Mr. Anderson Rover, who
was not in the best of health, was having much
trouble with brokers in New York City who were
trying to swindle him out of some property. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
brokers were Pelter, Jackson &amp; Company, and
it was not long before the Rover boys discovered
that Pelter was in league with Josiah Crabtree.
In a struggle poor Tom Rover was hit
on the head by a wooden footstool thrown by
Pelter and knocked unconscious. This had so
affected his mind that he wandered off to Alaska,
and Sam and Dick had many adventures
trying to locate him. When he was found he
was brought home and placed under the care of
a specialist, and soon was as well as ever.</p>

<p>Dick Rover was now growing older, and, with
his father in such poor health, it was decided
that the youth should leave Brill, become married
to Dora, and settle down in charge of the
office in Wall Street, New York. This plan was
carried out, as related in detail in the volume
preceding this, entitled "The Rover Boys in
Business." At that time, Sam and Tom still
remained at Brill, but an urgent message from
Dick brought them quickly to the metropolis.
A large number of unregistered bonds belonging
to the Rovers had mysteriously disappeared, and
all the boys went on a hunt to recover the securities.
In the end it was learned that their
old enemy, Jesse Pelter, was the guilty party,
and he was brought to justice. Then it was
felt that Dick needed assistance in the office,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and it was decided, much to Tom's satisfaction,
that he might get married to Nellie Laning and
move to the city.</p>

<p>"That will leave me all alone at Brill," said
Sam Rover at that time.</p>

<p>"Well, you shouldn't mind that so much," Tom
Rover had replied. "Remember, Grace will still
be at Hope," at which words the youngest
Rover had blushed deeply.</p>

<p>When the Rovers had gone to Brill College
they had been accompanied by their old-time
school chum, John Powell, always called "Songbird"
on account of his propensity for writing
doggerel which he insisted on calling poetry.
At the same time there came to Brill from Putnam
Hall one William Philander Tubbs, a very
dudish student with whom the boys often had
great fun.</p>

<p>It did not take the three Rover boys long
to make a number of friends at Brill. These
included Stanley Browne, a tall, gentlemanly
youth; Bob Grimes, who was greatly interested
in baseball; Will Jackson, always called Spud,
because of his unusual fondness for potatoes;
and Max Spangler, a German-American youth,
who was still struggling with the language, and
who had failed to advance in his studies, so that
at the present time he was only in the sophomore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
class. They had also made several enemies, but
these had for the time being left Brill.</p>

<p>"You'll be the hero of this occasion, Sam,"
remarked Stanley, as the students tramped in
the direction of the college campus.</p>

<p>"Hero of the occasion, I suppose, for hitting
Mr. Fogg in the head," returned Sam, with a
slight grin.</p>

<p>"Oh, forget that!" burst out Spud. "I don't
think he'll do a thing. Remember the affair occurred
on the college grounds, just as Stanley
said."</p>

<p>"Say! where is Songbird to-day?" asked Paul
Orben. "He ought to have been in this fight."</p>

<p>"He wanted to come very much," answered
Sam, "but he had a special errand to do for Mr.
Sanderson, who is laid up with a broken ankle."</p>

<p>"Was he doing the errand for Mr. Sanderson
or for Minnie?" questioned Stanley; and then
a short laugh went up, for it was well known
among the young collegians that Songbird Powell
and the daughter of Mr. Sanderson, a prosperous
farmer of that vicinity, were much attached
to each other.</p>

<p>As Sam Rover and his friends reached the
college campus, a great cheer arose.</p>

<p>"There he is!"</p>

<p>"Here the conquering hero comes!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us put him up on our shoulders, fellows!"
and a rush was made towards the youngest Rover
boy.</p>

<p>"Not much! Not to-day!" returned Sam, and
slid back behind some of his friends.</p>

<p>"Aw! come on, Sam!" cried one of the students.
"You are the hero of the occasion, and
you know it."</p>

<p>"Forget it, Snips," answered Sam. "What
did the fellows do with those banners?"</p>

<p>"Lentwell has them. He is keeping them for
you. I suppose you'll nail them up in your den?"</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know!"</p>

<p>"Maybe the freshies and sophs will want them
back," put in another youth in the crowd.</p>

<p>"Not much! They can have them back after
I graduate next June," answered Sam. "They
have got to understand&mdash;&mdash; Stop it, fellows,
stop it! I don't want to&mdash;&mdash; Well, if you've
got to, I suppose I'll have to submit." And an
instant later Sam found himself hoisted up on
the shoulders of several stalwart seniors, who
tramped around and around the college campus
with him while all the other seniors, and also
the juniors, cheered wildly and waved their caps.</p>

<p>"Doesn't that make you feel proud, Sam?"
asked Spud, during a lull in the proceedings.</p>

<p>"It sure does, Spud," was the quick reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
"I've only got one regret&mdash;that Dick and Tom
aren't here to share this victory with us."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a shame. And just to think of it,
after next June, when we graduate, we'll all be
scattered here, there, and everywhere, and the
good old times at Brill will be a thing of the
past."</p>

<p>"Don't mention such things," put in Stanley.
"It makes me sick clean to the heels every time
I think of it. But I suppose college days can't
last forever. We've got to go out into the
world, just as our fathers did before us."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I've got to get into business," answered
Sam. "I want to help father, as well as
Dick and Tom, all I can."</p>

<p>"Hi, fellows!" was the unexpected cry from
the lower end of the campus. "Here come the
freshies and the sophs back! Line up and be
ready to receive them!"</p>

<p>"That's it! Line up, line up, everybody!"
ordered Stanley. "Give them our old song of
victory!"</p>

<h3>WHAT HAPPENED TO SONGBIRD</h3>


<p>It was fully half an hour later before Sam
Rover could break away from his college chums
and run up to room Number 25, which he had
formerly occupied with his brother Tom and
which he now shared with Songbird Powell.</p>

<p>Nearly a week before, the youngest Rover
had made a date with Grace Laning, inviting
her, if the snow remained on the ground, to a
sleighride that afternoon and evening. At that
time Sam had forgotten completely that this
day was the date set for the annual snowballing
contest.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go anyway," he had remarked to
Songbird, the day before. But then had come
word to his roommate that Mr. Sanderson wanted
him on a matter of importance, and Stanley,
as the leader of the seniors, had insisted upon
it that he could not spare both of his chums.</p>

<p>"All right, then," Sam had answered finally;
"you can go, Songbird, and do what Mr. Sanderson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
wants you to, and I'll put off my sleighride
with Grace until after the contest;" and so
it had been settled.</p>

<p>There were no public turnouts at the college,
but Sam had arranged with Abner Filbury, who
worked around the place with his father, to
obtain for him a first-class horse and cutter from
the Ashton livery stable.</p>

<p>"That horse is some goer, believe me!" remarked
Abner, when he came to the door of
Sam's room, to tell him that the turnout was in
readiness. "You'll have to keep your eye on
him, Mr. Rover."</p>

<p>"All right, Ab. Trust me to take care of
him," returned Sam lightly. "Don't forget that
I was brought up on a farm, and my Uncle Randolph
had some pretty spirited animals."</p>

<p>"Have a good time, Sam!" cried Spud, who
was present to see his chum depart. "Wish I
was going to see such a nice girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, your time will come some day," answered
Sam.</p>

<p>"Are you going directly to Hope?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"I expect to unless you want to ride along that
far."</p>

<p>"Say! I'd like that first-rate," returned Spud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
eagerly. "I know some of the girls up there,
and I'd like to call on them. I wouldn't mind
walking back later on."</p>

<p>"Then come on if you are ready. I haven't
any time to wait."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm always ready," came from Spud;
and he lost no time in bestowing himself beside
Sam.</p>

<p>The latter gathered up the reins, gave a
slight chirp to the horse, and away they sped
out of the college grounds and on to the highway
leading past Hope Seminary, which was
about two miles distant.</p>

<p>The air was cool and bracing, and the snow
on the highway well packed down, so that the
cutter slid over it with ease. As Abner Filbury
had said, the steed was a mettlesome one,
and soon Sam found he had all he could do to
hold the horse in.</p>

<p>"Some goer, that!" remarked Spud, as he
pulled his cap down tighter to keep it from flying
off. "Puts me in mind of a race horse."</p>

<p>"Yes, I shouldn't wonder but what he could
make a mile in almost record time," responded
Sam, as they flew along past the trees, bushes
and occasional farm buildings which lined the
roadway near Brill.</p>

<p>"You want to watch yourself with a horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
that goes as fast as that," returned Spud, with
a chuckle. "If you don't, you'll get a mile or
two past Hope before you know it;" and at this
little joke Sam grinned.</p>

<p>Early in the ride they passed one or two cutters
and several farm wagons. Then they
reached a turn in the road, and to their surprise
saw ahead of them a sign resting on a
large wooden horse:</p>

<p>
ROAD CLOSED<br />
</p>

<p>"Hello! What does this mean?" queried Sam,
as he brought his horse to a standstill. "I didn't
know this road was shut off."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I heard something about this, come
to think of it," returned Spud. "They are going
to move that old Jackson barn from one
side of the road to the other, and they must
have closed the road for that purpose. You'll
have to take the old road on the left, Sam."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," grumbled the other. "Too
bad, too, for this road was just about perfect
for sleighing. But never mind, I suppose I can
get through on the other road well enough."</p>

<p>They turned back a distance of less than two
hundred feet, and then took to the side road
which Spud had mentioned. This was more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hilly than the other, and ran through a long patch
of timberland on which no houses were located.</p>

<p>"Hark! Don't I hear another sleigh coming?"
questioned Spud, a minute later.</p>

<p>"Something is coming, that's sure," answered
Sam. "Gracious me! Look at that!"</p>

<p>Coming to another bend of the woodland road,
the youngest Rover had barely time to pull his
steed well toward the right hand and almost
into some bushes when another cutter hove into
sight, coming along at a furious rate. The horse
was on a gallop, and the man driving him, a
fellow wrapped up in a heavy overcoat and with
a fur cap pulled far down over his forehead,
was using his whip freely.</p>

<p>"Wow! That fellow must be in some hurry,"
observed Spud, as the other turnout flashed past.
"He isn't sparing his horse any."</p>

<p>"It's a lucky thing for me that I pulled in here
as I did," returned Sam, and his tone of voice
showed his anger. "If I hadn't done it he would
have run into us, sure pop."</p>

<p>"You're right, Sam. That fellow had no
right to come along in that fashion. He ought
to be arrested for reckless driving. But maybe
he wants to catch a train at Ashton or something
like that."</p>

<p>"No train he could catch for an hour and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
half, Spud. And he could walk to the station
in that time;" and thus speaking, Sam chirruped
to the horse, and they resumed their ride.</p>

<p>A little farther on the woodland road made
another turn, and here the way was uphill. The
numerous rains of the summer previous had
washed the rocks bare of dirt, and often the cutter
bumped and scraped so badly that Sam was
compelled to bring his steed down to a walk.</p>

<p>"Well, one satisfaction, we'll be back to the
main road before long," observed Spud, as they
finally reached the top of the hill and could get
a view of the surroundings. "There is the other
road just below us."</p>

<p>"Hello! What's that ahead?" cried Sam,
pointing with his left hand. "Looks to me like
somebody lying in the snow."</p>

<p>"It is somebody!" exclaimed his chum. "Say!
do you suppose that other horse was running
away, and this fellow fell out?"</p>

<p>"Not much, with that other fellow using the
whip as he was!" returned Sam. "This fellow
ahead probably had nothing to do with that
other cutter. Excepting he may have been
knocked down by the horse," he added suddenly.</p>

<p>"That's what the trouble is! That rascal
knocked this fellow down and then hurried on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Sam! Poor fellow! I wonder if he is much
hurt?"</p>

<p>By this time the cutter had reached a point
opposite to where the person in the snow rested.
All the boys could see was some person, wrapped
in an overcoat, lying face downward. A cap
that looked strangely familiar to Sam lay close
at hand. Stopping the horse, Sam leaped from
the cutter, and Spud did the same.</p>

<p>"Say, Sam!" burst out the latter, "it looks
like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Songbird!" burst out the Rover boy. "It's
Songbird, Spud, and he's badly hurt."</p>

<p>It was indeed poor Songbird Powell who
rested there in the snow by the roadside. He
had on his overcoat and his fur-lined gloves,
but his head was bare, and from a cut on his
left temple the blood was flowing. The boys
turned their college chum over, and at this Songbird
uttered a low moan.</p>

<p>"He has either had an accident or been attacked,"
was Spud's comment. "I wonder how
badly he's hurt?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's pretty bad," answered Sam,
soberly. "That's a nasty cut. And say! his
chin is all swelled up as if he had been hit there
with a club!"</p>

<p>The two boys knelt beside their unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
chum and did what they could to revive him.
But Songbird did not open his eyes, nor did he
make any other sound than a low moan.</p>

<p>"We'll have to get him somewhere out of this
biting, cold air," observed Sam. "There is a
farmhouse just below here on the main road.
Let us put him in the cutter and carry him there."</p>

<p>When they picked Songbird up he uttered another
moan and for an instant his eyes opened;
but then he collapsed as before. They deposited
him on the seat of the turnout, and Sam picked
up his cap and several books that lay scattered
around. With sober faces the boys led the mettlesome
horse down the slope to the main road.
Both kept their eyes on their chum, but he still
remained insensible.</p>

<p>"Maybe he won't get over it," suggested Spud.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that!" cried Sam in horror.
"It can't be as bad as that." And then he added:
"Spud, did you notice the looks of that horse
when he dashed past us?"</p>

<p>"I didn't have time to notice much," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"Did he wear white stockings?"</p>

<p>"What? Oh! I know what you mean&mdash;white
feet. Yes, he had white feet. I know that
much."</p>

<p>"And did he have any white under his neck?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I think he did. Do you think you know
the horse, Sam?"</p>

<p>"I know Mr. Sanderson has a horse with
white feet and a white chest&mdash;a dark horse,
just like that one was."</p>

<p>"Then it must have been Mr. Sanderson's
horse and cutter!" cried Spud. "If it was, do
you think that man was running away with the
outfit?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think, Spud. To my
mind it's a mighty serious piece of business.
But our first duty is to do all we can for poor
Songbird."</p>

<p>Arriving at the nearest farmhouse, Spud ran
ahead and knocked on the door. A woman answered
the summons, and as she happened to
know the youth, she readily consented to have
Songbird brought in and laid on a couch in the
dining-room. Hardly had this been done when
the sufferer slowly opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Don&mdash;don't hit m-m-me again!" he murmured.
"Ple-please don't!"</p>

<p>"It's all right, Songbird. Don't you know
me?" said Sam, quietly.</p>

<p>The injured collegian opened his eyes again
and stared at the youth before him.</p>

<p>"Sam! Wh-where did you co-come from?"</p>

<p>"Spud and I found you on the road, face down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in the snow," answered Sam. "What happened?
Did you fall out of the cutter, or were you attacked?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; Oh! how my head spins!" muttered
Songbird. He closed his eyes again and
was silent for a moment. Then he looked once
more at Sam.</p>

<p>"I was attacked," he mumbled. "The man&mdash;he
hit me&mdash;with a club&mdash;and hauled me out of
the cutter."</p>

<p>"It must have been the fellow we saw on
the road!" exclaimed Spud. "Songbird, why did
he do it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;do-don't know," mumbled the sufferer.
"But maybe I do!" he suddenly shouted, in a
strangely unnatural voice. Then with a sudden
strength born of fear, he raised his left hand
and dived down into the inner pocket of his coat.
"The package! It's gone!"</p>

<p>"The package! What package?" queried Sam.</p>

<p>"The package belonging to Mr. Sanderson!"
gasped poor Songbird. "The package with the
four thousand dollars in it! It's gone!" and
with another groan Songbird lapsed once more
into unconsciousness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE CHASE</h3>


<p>It must be confessed that Sam and Spud, as
well as the woman of the house, were very much
surprised over the statement made by Songbird.</p>

<p>"Attacked and robbed!" murmured Sam.
"What an awful thing to do!"</p>

<p>"He said he had been robbed of four thousand
dollars!" broke in Spud. "Where in the world
would he get that much money? He must be
dreaming, Sam."</p>

<p>"I hardly think so, Spud. I know he was to
go on a very important errand for Mr. Sanderson,
who is laid up at home with a sprained
ankle."</p>

<p>"Well, if Songbird was robbed, it's more than
likely the fellow we saw in the cutter did it."</p>

<p>"Exactly! And the chances are he will get
away just as fast as he possibly can," added Sam,
bitterly.</p>

<p>"What do you think we ought to do?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think we ought to notify the authorities,
Spud."</p>

<p>"Hadn't we better wait until we get some
particulars from Songbird?"</p>

<p>"Not much! The quicker we get after that
fellow the better. Remember he is running away
not only with the money but also with Mr. Sanderson's
horse and cutter. Many people living
in this vicinity know Mr. Sanderson's animal, and
that may help us to locate that rascal." Sam
turned to the woman of the house. "Have you
a telephone?"</p>

<p>"No, we haven't any; but the folks in the next
house up the road have one."</p>

<p>"Then I'll go there and telephone," said Sam.
"You do what you can for Songbird, Spud. I'll
try to get a doctor, too, while I'm at it."</p>

<p>In a few seconds more Sam was on the way,
using his horse and cutter for that purpose. Arriving
at the next farmhouse, he readily received
permission to use the telephone, and at once
got into communication with the authorities in
Ashton, and asked the official in charge to send
word around to the various towns and villages
within the next ten or fifteen miles, and he also
sent word to a physician at Ashton. Then he
managed to get Grace on the wire.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'll be late," he told the girl. "And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
maybe I won't be able to get there at all," he
added. "Songbird has been knocked down on
the road and robbed, and he is in pretty bad
shape."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam! isn't that too bad!" was Grace's
reply. "Do you mean that he is seriously injured?"</p>

<p>"We can't tell yet, Grace. I have just telephoned
for the doctor, and now I am going back
to the Bray farmhouse, where Songbird is, to
wait for him." And after that Sam gave the
girl as many details of the affair as he deemed
necessary.</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope he gets over it, Sam," said Grace.
"And to think he was robbed of all that money!
If they can't get it back, what ever will Songbird
and the Sandersons do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he returned. "It certainly is
a bad piece of business. But now I've got to go
back, so I'll say good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Sam, and you stay with Songbird
just as long as you please. We can have our
sleighride some other time."</p>

<p>When Sam returned to the Bray farmhouse
he found that Spud and the lady of the house
had washed Songbird's wound and bound it up.
The lady had also brought forth some simple
home remedies, and these had been so efficacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
that Songbird was sitting on the couch, propped
up by numerous pillows.</p>

<p>"Did you catch him?" asked the sufferer eagerly,
as Sam entered.</p>

<p>"I've sent word to the police, Songbird, and
sent word for a doctor too. Now you had better
take it easy until the doctor comes."</p>

<p>"But how can I take it easy with that four
thousand dollars missing?" groaned the youth
on the couch. "Why, I can't make that amount
up, and Mr. Sanderson can't afford to lose it."</p>

<p>"How does your head feel?"</p>

<p>"It feels sore all over, and sometimes spins
like a top. But I wouldn't care about that if only
I could get that money back. Can't you and
Spud go after that rascal?"</p>

<p>"I'm willing if you want us to, Songbird; but
you'll have to promise to stay here until the
doctor comes. We don't want you to attempt to
do anything while you are in your present condition."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll stay here, don't fear," answered
Songbird, grimly. "I just tried to stand up, and
I went in a heap, and Spud and the lady had
to put me back on this couch."</p>

<p>"Let's take that horse of yours and go after
that fellow, Sam," burst out Spud, eagerly.
"That horse is a goer, as we know, and we ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
to be able to catch that man sooner or later."</p>

<p>"Providing we can follow his trail, Spud," answered
Sam. "You must remember there are a
good many side roads around here, and he can
take to any one he pleases."</p>

<p>"But we might be able to find the footprints
of the horse in the snow."</p>

<p>"Possibly, although I doubt it, with so many
other horses using the highway. However, come
on, we'll do the best we can." Sam turned again
to the sufferer. "Now, Songbird, you keep quiet
until the doctor comes, and then you do exactly
as he orders."</p>

<p>"Maybe Mrs. Bray will see to that," ventured
Spud.</p>

<p>"I will if you want me to," responded the
woman of the house. "That cut on his head is
a nasty one, and if he doesn't take care of himself
it may make him real sick."</p>

<p>In a moment more Sam and Spud were out
of the house and into the cutter, which was then
headed up the side road where they had found
Songbird. Here they stopped for an instant to
take another look around, and picked up two
more books which had escaped their notice
before.</p>

<p>"Books of poetry, both of 'em," remarked
Spud. "Songbird thinks more of a poem than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
does of a square meal," and he smiled a bit
grimly.</p>

<p>It did not take long to reach the spot where the
other cutter had passed them. They went straight
on, soon reaching the point where the woodland
road joined the main highway.</p>

<p>"Now, you see, here is where we are going to
get mixed up," announced Sam, as they moved
in the direction of Brill. "Did the fellow go
straight to Ashton, or did he turn off to one of
the other places?"</p>

<p>"The folks traveling along the road must have
seen him," returned Spud. "Let us make some
inquiries as we go along."</p>

<p>This was a good suggestion, and was carried
out. They found a farmer who had seen the
strange man in the cutter drive toward Ashton,
and a little later they met two ladies in a sleigh
who declared that the fellow had turned into a
side road leading to a hamlet known as Lester's
Corners.</p>

<p>"If he went there, we ought to have a chance
to catch him," cried Spud. "This road I know
doesn't go beyond the Corners."</p>

<p>"Yes. But he could take a road from there
to Dentonville," answered Sam, "and you know
that is quite a railroad station."</p>

<p>"But if he went to Dentonville and to the railroad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
station, couldn't you telephone to the operator
there to have him held?"</p>

<p>"Maybe, Spud, providing there is any telephone
at the Corners."</p>

<p>Onward they went once more, through some
heavy woodland and then over several small hills,
finally coming in sight of the Corners, where
were located a general store, a blacksmith's shop,
a chapel, and about a dozen houses.</p>

<p>"Did I see a feller in a cutter goin' as fast as
he could?" repeated the storekeeper, when questioned
by Sam. "You just bet I did. Gee whiz!
but he was goin' to beat the band!"</p>

<p>"And which way did he head?" questioned the
Rover boy, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Headed right straight for Dentonville."</p>

<p>"And how long ago was this?" put in Spud.</p>

<p>"Oh, about quarter of an hour, I should say.
Say! he nearly skeered old Mrs. Rasley to deth.
She was a-crossin' the road comin' to my store
when he swung aroun' that corner yonder, and
he come within a foot of runnin' over her. She
wanted to git Joe Mason, the constable, to arrest
him, but, gee whiz! there wasn't no arrestin'
to it&mdash;he was out o' sight before you could say
Jack Robinson."</p>

<p>"Have you any telephone connection with
Dentonville?" questioned Sam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ain't got no telephone here at all. The telephone
fellers promised to put a line through here
three years ago, but somehow they hain't got
around to doin' it. You see, Squire Buzby owns
some of their stock, and he don't think that we
ought to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's all right, Captain," broke in Sam, hastily.
"Then if we want to catch that fellow, all
we can do is to go after him, eh?"</p>

<p>"Thet's about the size on it," returned the
storekeeper. "Now you see if we had thet telephone
here, we might be able to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's so, we might. But as the telephone is
missing, we'll go after him in our cutter," broke
in Sam; and a few seconds later he and Spud
were once more on their way.</p>

<p>The road to Dentonville was not much traveled,
and for a mile and a half they met no one.
Then, just as they reached a crossing, they came
in sight of an old farmer driving a box-sled filled
with milk cans.</p>

<p>"Did you meet a man driving a horse and cutter
very rapidly?" questioned Sam, after he drew
up. "A dark horse with a white breast and white
feet?"</p>

<p>"I jest guess I did!" replied the farmer. "He
come pretty close to runnin' into me."</p>

<p>"Which way was he headed?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p>"Headed straight for Dentonville."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me when the next train stops
there?"</p>

<p>"The train is due there in about fifteen minutes,
and she won't stop more'n long enough to
put my milk cans on board. I jest left 'em there,
and got these empty ones," explained the farmer,
pointing to the cans behind him.</p>

<p>"Fifteen minutes!" cried Spud. "And how far
is it from here?"</p>

<p>"Nigh on to three miles."</p>

<p>"Is it a good road?" queried Sam.</p>

<p>"Pretty fair. It's some washed out on the
hills, but the snow has covered the wo'st of the
holes. Want to ketch that feller?"</p>

<p>"We certainly do. That horse and cutter belongs
to Mr. Sanderson."</p>

<p>"By gum! You don't say! Did he steal the
turnout?"</p>

<p>"He certainly did," answered Spud, "and nearly
killed a young fellow in the bargain."</p>

<p>"Then I hope you ketch 'im," answered the
farmer, and stood up in his sled to watch Sam
and Spud as they sped once more along the highway
leading to Dentonville.</p>

<p>The boys had a long hill ahead, and before the
top was gained the horse attached to the cutter
was glad enough to settle down to a walk. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
once the ridge was passed, he did not need much
urging, and flew along almost as rapidly as ever.</p>

<p>"This horse must have been in the stable for
quite some time," remarked Spud. "He evidently
enjoys the outing thoroughly."</p>

<p>"Listen!" cried Sam, a little later. "Isn't that
the whistle of a locomotive?"</p>

<p>"It sure is, Sam! That must be the train coming
into Dentonville!"</p>

<p>They were passing through a small patch of
timber, and directly beyond were the cleared
fields and the buildings of a tidy farm. As the
boys came out of the woods they looked over
the fields in the direction of Dentonville and saw
a mixed train, composed of several passenger
coaches and a string of freights, entering the
station.</p>

<p>"There she is!" cried Sam. "Oh, if only we
can get there before she leaves!"</p>

<p>He spoke to the horse and did what he could
to urge the steed forward at a greater rate of
speed than ever. Much to the astonishment of
several onlookers, they dashed into the outskirts
of Dentonville and then along the main street
leading down to the railroad station.</p>

<p>"Hi! Stop!" roared a voice at them, just as
they were crossing one of the side streets, directly
in front of a sleigh and two wagons. "Hi!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Stop, I tell you! You ain't got no right to drive
that fast here in town," and a blue-coated policeman,
one of the four of which the place boasted,
shook his club at the boys and ran out in front
of their cutter.</p>

<span class="caption">A BLUE-COATED POLICEMAN SHOOK HIS CLUB AT THE BOYS.</span>
</div>

<p>"Say! officer, you are just the man we want,"
cried Sam, hurriedly. "Come on with us. We
want to have a man arrested down at the depot
before he has a chance to get away on the train."</p>

<p>"What's that? Want a man arrested?" queried
the bluecoat. "What has he done?"</p>

<p>"A whole lot of things," broke in Spud.
"Jump in; we haven't any time to explain now&mdash;that
train may pull out at any moment."</p>

<p>"That's so; so it might," replied the officer;
and then, as Spud made room for him, he sprang
into the cutter, sitting on the boy's lap. "But
you look out that you don't kill somebody," he
added to Sam, who was now using the whip lightly
to urge the horse to greater efforts.</p>

<p>They were still two blocks away from the
railroad station when there came a whistle, followed
by the clanging of a bell, and then they
saw the train moving away.</p>

<p>"There she goes!" groaned Spud. "But she
isn't moving very fast."</p>

<p>"Maybe we can catch her yet," returned Sam;
and then the race continued as before.</p>

<h3>AT THE RAILROAD STATION</h3>


<p>"See anybody, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Nobody that looks like that man, Spud, but
there is Mr. Sanderson's horse with the cutter."</p>

<p>"Yes, I spotted those right away. Look how
the poor nag is heaving. He must have been
driven almost to death."</p>

<p>"That may be. Although we got here almost
as quickly as he did. But he may have been used
quite some before this trip," returned Sam; and
this surmise was correct.</p>

<p>The two boys, with the policeman, had done
their best to catch the departing train and have
it stop, but without avail. When they had reached
the depot the last of the cars was well down
the line, and soon the train had disappeared
around a curve of the roadbed.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Ike? What are you
after?" queried the freight agent, as he came up
to the policeman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are after the man who was driving that
cutter yonder," explained Sam. "Did you see
him&mdash;a big fellow with a heavy overcoat and
with a fur cap pulled down over his forehead?"</p>

<p>"Why yes, I saw that fellow get aboard," answered
the freight agent. "I was wondering
what he was going to do with his horse. He
didn't even stop to put a blanket over the animal."</p>

<p>"That fellow was a thief," explained Sam. "I
wonder if we can't have him captured in some
way? What is the next station the train will
stop at?"</p>

<p>"Penton."</p>

<p>"How far is that from here?"</p>

<p>"About six miles."</p>

<p>"And after that?"</p>

<p>"She'll stop at Leadenfield, which is about six
miles farther."</p>

<p>"Then I'll send a telegram to Penton and another
to Leadenfield to have the train searched
and the man arrested if he can be spotted," said
Sam; and a few minutes later he was in the
telegraph office writing out the messages. He described
the man as well as he could, but realized
that his efforts were rather hopeless.</p>

<p>"Maybe Songbird could give us a better description,"
he said to his chum; "but as Songbird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
isn't here, and as we can't get him on the telephone,
we'll have to do the best we can."</p>

<p>The policeman was, of course, anxious to
know some of the details of what had occurred,
and when the boys told him that their college
chum had been knocked senseless and robbed of
four thousand dollars he was greatly surprised.</p>

<p>"It's too bad you didn't get here before the
train started," he observed. "If you had we
might have nabbed that rascal and maybe got
a reward," and he smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"We don't want any reward. We simply
want to get that four thousand dollars back,"
returned Sam. "And we would like to put that
fellow in prison for the way he treated our college
chum."</p>

<p>"What will you do with the horse and cutter?"</p>

<p>"If there is a livery stable handy, I think I'll
put the horse up there," answered Sam. "He
is evidently in no condition to be driven farther
at present. I'll notify Mr. Sanderson about it."
And so it was arranged.</p>

<p>A little while later, after the two boys had
walked around to the police station with the
officer and given such particulars as they were
able concerning the assault and robbery, Sam
and Spud started on the return to the Bray farmhouse.
When they arrived there, they found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Dr. Havens and Dr. Wallington had come in
some time before. By the directions of the head
of Brill the physician from Ashton had given
Songbird a thorough examination and had treated
him with some medicine from his case.</p>

<p>"The cut on his head is rather a deep one,"
said the doctor to the boys, "but fortunately it
is not serious, nor will there be any bad effects
from the blow on his chin. He can thank his
stars though that the crack on his head did not
fracture his skull."</p>

<p>"We are going to take him back to Brill in a
large sleigh," said Dr. Wallington, "and then
I think the best he can do will be to go to
bed."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't do that!" broke in Songbird, who
was still on the couch, propped up by pillows.
"I've got to get to Mr. Sanderson's and explain
how the thing happened."</p>

<p>"You had better let me do that, Songbird,"
answered Sam, kindly. "I can drive over there
and Spud can go with me. You just let us know
exactly how it occurred." This, of course, was
after the boys had related the particulars of their
failure to catch the fleeing criminal at Dentonville.</p>

<p>"It happened so quickly that I hardly realized
what was taking place," answered the would-be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
poet of Brill. "I was driving along from Knoxbury,
where I had been to the bank for Mr. Sanderson,
when I came to the spot where I suppose
you found me. Just as I reached there a man in
a heavy overcoat, and with a thick fur cap pulled
over his face so that I could hardly see him,
stepped in front of the cutter.</p>

<p>"'Say! can you tell me where these people
live?' he asked me, and thrust a sheet of paper
towards me. 'I've lost my eye-glasses, and I
can't see to read without them.'</p>

<p>"I took the paper he handed out and started
to look at some writing on it which was very
indistinct. As I bent over the paper the man
swung a club or something in the air and struck
me on the head. Then, as I tried to leap up and
defend myself, he hit me another blow on the
chin. That seemed to knock me clean out of
the cutter; and that is all I know about it."</p>

<p>"Then you don't know where that fellow came
from?" queried Spud.</p>

<p>"No more than that he came from the bushes
beside the road." Songbird seemed to meditate
for a moment. "Now I come to think of it
though, maybe that's the same fellow that
watched me go into the bank at Knoxbury and
get the money for Mr. Sanderson!" he cried, suddenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was a very unwise move on Mr. Sanderson's
part to have you get that money for him
in cash," observed Dr. Wallington. "I do not
understand why he could not have transacted his
business with a check, especially if it was certified."</p>

<p>"I don't know much about that part of it,"
answered Songbird, "excepting he told me that
the old man with whom he was doing business
was something of a crank and didn't believe in
banks or checks, and said he wanted nothing
but solid cash. It's a pity now that Mr. Sanderson
didn't use a check," and Songbird heaved a
deep sigh.</p>

<p>"But what did you just say about a man watching
you when you went into the bank?" questioned
Sam.</p>

<p>"Oh, I noticed that fellow hanging around the
building just as I went in," returned Songbird.
"He was asking the janitor about the trains out
of town, and the reason I noticed him was because
he had a peculiar stutter and whistle when
he talked. He went like this," and Songbird imitated
a man who was stuttering badly, ending in
a faint whistle.</p>

<p>"Great Scott! A fellow ought to know a man
who talked like that anywhere," was Spud's comment.
"Should be able to pick him out in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
dark," and at this sally even Dr. Wallington
smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm not sure that that man had
anything to do with it," went on Songbird. "But
he was the only fellow around who seemed to
notice me when I got the money. When the
bills were passed over to me, there were forty
one-hundred-dollar bills. I took them to a little
side stand, to place them in a wallet Mr. Sanderson
had lent me, and then I wrapped the wallet
in a piece of paper with a stout string around
it. As I did this I noticed the man who stuttered
and whistled peering at me hungrily
through a side window of the bank."</p>

<p>"And the fellow wore a heavy overcoat and
a fur cap?" questioned Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure of that."</p>

<p>"Then it is more than likely he was the guilty
party," remarked Spud.</p>

<p>"But hold on a minute!" broke in Sam. "You
got the money at Knoxbury, and this attack took
place on the road above here, which is at least
seven miles from that place. Now, if the man
who did the deed was at the bank when you
drew the money, how did he get here in time to
hold you up?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, Sam; but I didn't
leave Knoxbury immediately after getting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
money. I had an errand to do for Minnie. She
wanted me to pick out a&mdash;er&mdash;a necktie for my
birthday, and I&mdash;well, I looked around two or
three stores, trying to find something nice to
take back to her. I bought two books of poetry,
but I don't know where they are now."</p>

<p>"We found them on the road, and they are
out in the cutter," answered Sam. "Spud, you
might bring them in and give them to Songbird."</p>

<p>"The errands kept me in town for about half
an hour after I was at the bank," continued the
youth who had been attacked.</p>

<p>"And where had you left Mr. Sanderson's
cutter in the meantime?"</p>

<p>"Right in front of the bank building, the horse
tied to a post."</p>

<p>"That would give the man time to get another
turnout in which to follow you," said Sam.</p>

<p>"But if he did that, I don't see how he got
ahead of you."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe he didn't, and maybe it was
some one else who did the deed," returned Sam.</p>

<p>"You had better not worry your head too much
about this affair, Mr. Powell," said Dr. Havens.
"That crack on the head might have been more
serious, but at the same time you ought to take
care of yourself for a day or two at least."</p>

<p>"Then you don't think I ought to go to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Sanderson's?" queried the would-be poet of the
college.</p>

<p>"Not just yet. If you feel stronger you
might go there to-morrow, or the day after."</p>

<p>"Then will you go, Sam, and try to explain
matters?" questioned Songbird, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll go, Songbird."</p>

<p>"And I'll go with him," added Spud.</p>

<p>A large sleigh had been brought to the farmhouse
by Dr. Wallington, and Songbird was
placed in this and made as comfortable as possible
among the robes and blankets which it
contained. Mr. Bray, the owner of the farm,
had been up in the timber bringing down some
firewood, and now, when he approached, the
others saw that he had tied behind his sled an
extra horse.</p>

<p>"Hello! Where did that horse come from?"
cried Sam. "Is it yours?"</p>

<p>"No, 'tain't mine," said Timothy Bray. "I
found it up in the woods right near the road
yonder," and he pointed with his hand as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"Found that horse in the woods!" cried Spud.
"Then that explains it."</p>

<p>"It sure does," returned Sam.</p>

<p>"Explains what?" demanded Timothy Bray.
"What's goin' on down here anyway?" he continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
looking at his wife and then at the others.</p>

<p>"Oh, Timothy! an awful thing has happened!"
cried Mrs. Bray, and then she and the others
gave the farmer a few of the particulars. He
listened with mouth wide open, and then looked
at the horse which he had found.</p>

<p>"I guess you are right!" he exclaimed. "That
feller got this horse in Knoxbury. It's one that
belongs to Hoover, the livery stable man. I
know him on account of this brand on his left
flank. It's a horse Cy Tamen used to own and
swapped for a bay mare."</p>

<p>"Then I think that explains it," declared Sam.
"That rascal saw Songbird get the money, and
he at once went to the livery stable and hired
the horse and followed Songbird to the spot
where the attack was made. More than likely
he passed Songbird on the road."</p>

<p>"That's just what he did!" cried the youth
who had been struck down. "I remember now!
I was busy composing some poetry when I noticed
a fellow on horseback go past me and disappear
around a turn in the road, and that was
just a few minutes before that fellow came up
with a sheet of paper, and knocked me senseless."</p>

<p>"I believe you have made out a pretty clear
case," was Dr. Wallington's comment. "Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
if we can only reach that man who stuttered
and whistled, I think we shall have the culprit."</p>

<p>"We telephoned ahead from Dentonville. If
they can only locate him on the train it will be
all right," answered Sam. "But you must remember
we didn't have very much of a description
to go by."</p>

<p>"Yes, and that fellow may be fixed to change
his appearance a good deal," added Spud. "A
man isn't going to get his hands on four thousand
dollars without doing all he possibly can to
get away with it, especially when he knows that
if he is caught he will be sent to prison."</p>

<p>"What am I going to do with this horse?"
questioned Timothy Bray.</p>

<p>"You had better keep that animal in your stable
until the livery man from Knoxbury calls
for him," answered Dr. Wallington.</p>

<p>"He'll have to pay me for doing it," was Mr.
Bray's reply. "Every time I go to Knoxbury,
Hoover charges me an outrageous price for putting
up at his stable, and now I can get even
with him," and he chuckled over the thought.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>AT THE SANDERSON HOME</h3>


<p>It was just about supper time when Sam, accompanied
by Spud, drove into the lane beside
the Sanderson farmhouse, which was lit up from
end to end.</p>

<p>Evidently Minnie Sanderson, the pretty daughter
of the farmer, had been on the watch, for
as they approached the house she came out on
a side piazza to meet them.</p>

<p>"Why, Songbird! what kept you so long?" she
cried, and then added: "Who's that with you?"</p>

<p>"It isn't Songbird, Minnie," answered Sam,
after he sprang out of the cutter, followed by
Spud. "We've got some news for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam Rover!" exclaimed the girl. "And
Will Jackson! Whatever brought you here?
Where is Songbird&mdash;do you know anything
about him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we do; and that is what brought us
here," answered Sam.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam! you don't mean that&mdash;that something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
has happened to John?" faltered the girl,
turning pale.</p>

<p>"Yes, something did happen, Minnie, but don't
be alarmed&mdash;he isn't hurt very much. Come into
the house and we'll tell you and your father all
about it."</p>

<p>"Hurt! Oh, are you sure it isn't serious?
Now please don't hold anything back."</p>

<p>"I'll give you my word, Minnie, it isn't serious.
The doctor said he would be as well as
ever in a few days, but he is rather knocked
out, and the doctor said he had better not try
to come here. So then he asked Spud and me
to come."</p>

<p>While Sam was speaking he and Spud had led
the girl back into the house. She was very much
agitated and her manner showed it.</p>

<p>"But what was it, Sam? Do tell me. Did
that horse run away with him? I know John
isn't much of a driver, and when he gets to composing
poetry he doesn't notice things and becomes
so careless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Minnie, it was not that. Where is your
father? We'll go to him and then we'll tell you
the whole story."</p>

<p>"What's this I hear?" came from the dining-room,
where Mr. Sanderson rested in a Morris
chair, with his sprained ankle perched on a footstool.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
"Where is John? And what about that
money he was to get for me?"</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Sanderson," said Sam,
coming in and shaking hands, followed by Spud.
"We've got some bad news for you, but please
don't blame Songbird&mdash;I mean John&mdash;for I am
sure he was not to blame."</p>

<p>"That's right!" broke in Spud. "What happened
might have occurred to any of us. I think
we ought to be thankful that Songbird&mdash;that's
the name we all call John, you know&mdash;wasn't
killed."</p>

<p>"Oh, but do tell me what did happen!" pleaded
Minnie.</p>

<p>"And what about my money&mdash;is that safe?"
demanded Mr. Sanderson.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Sanderson. I am sorry to say the
fellow who attacked Songbird got away with it."</p>

<p>"Gone! My four thousand dollars gone!"
ejaculated the farmer. "Don't tell me that. I
can't afford to lose any such amount. Why!
it's the savings of years!" and his face showed
his intense anxiety.</p>

<p>"Oh, so John was attacked! Who did it? I
suppose they must have half killed the poor boy
in order to get the money away from him,"
wailed Minnie.</p>

<p>"We might as well tell you the whole story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
from beginning to end," answered Sam, and then,
after he and Spud had taken off their overcoats
and gloves, both plunged into all the details of
the occurrence as they knew them.</p>

<p>"And he was hit on the head and on the chin!
Oh, how dreadful!" burst out Minnie. "And
are you positive, Sam, it was not serious?"</p>

<p>"That is what Dr. Havens said, and he made
a close examination in the presence of Dr. Wallington."</p>

<p>"He ought to have been more careful," said
Mr. Sanderson, bitterly.</p>

<p>"But, Pa! how could he have been?" interposed
the daughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, in lots of ways. He might have placed
that money inside of his shirt," answered the
father. "It don't do to carry four thousand dollars
around just as if it was&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;book of
poetry or something like that," he added, with a
touch of sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Pa, I think it's real mean of you to talk that
way!" flared up Minnie. "John told me that
he didn't much like the idea of bringing that
four thousand dollars in cash from the bank,
but he undertook the errand just to please
you."</p>

<p>"Humph! Well, I was foolish to send him on
the errand. I should have got some man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
knew how to take care of such an amount of
cash."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sanderson, I don't think it's fair for you
to blame Songbird," broke in Spud. "He did the
best he could, and, of course, he had no idea that
he was going to be attacked."</p>

<p>"It's all well enough for you to talk, young
man," broke out the farmer, angrily; "it wasn't
your four thousand dollars that was stolen. I
wanted that money to pay off the mortgage on
this farm. It's due to-morrow, and the reason
I wanted cash was because old Grisley insisted
on cash and nothing else. He lost a lot of money
in the bank years ago, and that soured him, so
he wouldn't take a check nohow. Now what I'm
going to do if I can't pay that mortgage, I don't
know. And me down here with a sprained ankle,
too!" he added with increasing bitterness.</p>

<p>"You'll have to tell Mr. Grisley to wait for
his money," said Sam. "When he learns the particulars
of this affair he ought to be willing to
wait."</p>

<p>"If I could only walk I'd get on the trail of
that thief somehow," muttered Mr. Sanderson.
"It's a shame I've got to sit here and do nothin'
when four thousand dollars of mine is floatin'
away, nobody knows where."</p>

<p>"We have notified the police and sent telegrams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
ahead, just as I told you," answered Sam.
"I don't see what more we can do at present.
Songbird was attacked so suddenly that he isn't
sure that the fellow who did it is the same fellow
he saw around the Knoxbury bank or not.
But if he is the same fellow, we have a pretty
fair description of him, and sooner or later the
authorities may be able to run him down."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know the police!" snorted the farmer.
"They ain't worth a hill of beans."</p>

<p>"Well, Songbird told me to tell you that if
the money is not recovered, he will do all he can
to make good the loss," continued Sam.</p>

<p>"Make good the loss? Has he got four thousand
dollars?" questioned the farmer, curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Songbird isn't as wealthy as all
that. He has only his regular allowance. But
he said he'd work and earn the money, if he
had to."</p>

<p>"Humph! How is he going to earn it&mdash;writing
poetry? They don't pay much for that kind
of writing, to my way of thinking."</p>

<p>"Now, Pa, please don't get so excited," soothed
the daughter. "Let us be thankful that John
wasn't killed. If he had been, I never would
have forgiven you for having sent him on that
errand."</p>

<p>"Oh, now, don't you pitch into me. Minnie!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
cried the father. "I've lost my four thousand
dollars and that's bad enough. If I can't pay
that mortgage, Grisley may foreclose and then
you and me will be out of a home."</p>

<p>"Nothing like that will happen, Mr. Sanderson,"
said Sam.</p>

<p>"I don't know why."</p>

<p>"The mortgage is on this farm, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it the only mortgage you have, if I may
ask?"</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"And what do you consider the farm worth?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was offered eight thousand dollars for
it last year, and I refused to sell."</p>

<p>"Then I think it will be an easy matter to
arrange to have the mortgage taken up by somebody
else. Possibly my father or my uncle will
do it."</p>

<p>"Will they?" demanded Mr. Sanderson,
eagerly. "Well, of course, that would be some
help, but, at the same time, it wouldn't bring my
four thousand dollars back," he added glumly.</p>

<p>After that Minnie demanded to know more
concerning Songbird's condition, and the two
youths gave her every possible detail.</p>

<p>"If I had a telephone here I might send word
to Ashton to find out if they had tracked that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
rascal yet," said Mr. Sanderson. "But they asked
so much money to put a telephone in over here
I didn't have 'em do it."</p>

<p>"Where is the nearest telephone?" questioned
Spud.</p>

<p>"Nothin' closer nor the railroad station at
Busby's Crossing."</p>

<p>"That's only half a mile away," put in Sam.
"We might drive over there now and see if there
is anything new."</p>

<p>"You wait until you have had your supper,"
interposed Minnie. "It's all ready. I was expecting
John, you know," and she blushed
slightly.</p>

<p>"But if your father is anxious to get
word&mdash;&mdash;" began the Rover boy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose you might as well wait and
have somethin' to eat first," said the farmer.
"That will give the authorities time to do somethin',
if they are goin' to."</p>

<p>In the expectation of having Songbird to supper,
Minnie, with the aid of a young hired girl,
had provided quite an elaborate meal, to which
it is perhaps needless to state the young collegians
did full justice. Then the youths lost no
time in driving off in the cutter to Busby's Crossing,
where they were lucky enough to find the
station agent still in charge, although on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
point of locking up, for no more trains would
stop at the Crossing that night.</p>

<p>The boys first telephoned to the college and to
Ashton, and then to Dentonville and the railroad
stations up the line. To get the various
connections took considerable time, and to get
"information that was no information at all," as
Spud expressed it, took much longer still. The
sum total of it was that no one had been able
to trace the man in the heavy overcoat and with
the heavy fur cap, and no one had the slightest
idea about what had become of that much-wanted
individual.</p>

<p>"It's going to be like looking for the proverbial
pin in the haystack," remarked Spud.</p>

<p>"It's too bad," returned Sam, gloomily. "I
did think we'd have some sort of encouraging
word to take back to Mr. Sanderson."</p>

<p>"Say! he's pretty bitter over the loss of that
money, isn't he, Sam?"</p>

<p>"You can't blame him for that. I'd be bitter
too."</p>

<p>"It looks to me as if he might make Minnie
break with Songbird if that money wasn't recovered."</p>

<p>"Possibly, Spud. Although he ought to know
as well as we do that it was not Songbird's
fault."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm glad to see Minnie sticks up for our
chum, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Minnie's all right and always has been.
She thinks just as much of Songbird as he does
of her. Once in a while she pokes a little fun
at his so-called poetry, but Songbird doesn't
mind, so it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>When the boys returned to the farmhouse
Minnie ran out to meet them, and from their
manner saw at once that they had no news worth
mentioning. They could see that the girl had
been crying, and now it was all she could do to
keep from bursting into tears again.</p>

<p>"Oh, Minnie, you ought not to take it so hard,"
said Sam, kindly. "Of course, to lose four thousand
dollars is a terrible blow, but maybe they'll
get the money back some way, or at least a part
of it."</p>

<p>"It isn't the money, Sam," cried the girl, with
something like a catch in her voice. "It's the
way papa acts. He seems to think it was all
John's fault. Oh! I can't bear it! I know I
can't!" she suddenly sobbed, and then ran away
and up the stairs to her bedroom, closing the door
behind her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>SAM AND GRACE</h3>


<p>"This whole affair is certainly a tough proposition,"
remarked Sam, when, about half an hour
later, he and Spud were on their way back to
Brill.</p>

<p>The time had been spent in telling Mr. Sanderson
how they had failed to obtain any satisfaction
over the telephone, and in listening to the
farmer's tirade against poor Songbird.</p>

<p>"Old Sanderson certainly pitched into Songbird,"
returned Spud. "I declare if anybody
called me down that way, I think I'd be apt to
get into a regular fight with him."</p>

<p>"He is very much excited, Spud. I think when
he cools down he will see matters in a different
light. Just at present the loss of the four thousand
dollars has completely upset him."</p>

<p>"I suppose he pitched into Minnie even more
than he pitched into us."</p>

<p>"Maybe he did. I must say I am mighty sorry
for that poor girl."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you going to tell Songbird?"</p>

<p>"I suppose we'll have to tell him the truth,
Spud, although we'll have to smooth over Mr.
Sanderson's manner as much as we can. There's
no use in hurting Songbird's feelings, especially
now when he's broken up physically as well as
mentally."</p>

<p>When they reached the college they found
that Songbird had insisted upon it that he be
taken to the room he occupied with Sam instead
of to the sick ward. He was in bed, but wide
awake and anxious to hear all they might have
to say.</p>

<p>"Of course I knew Mr. Sanderson would
blame me," he said, after asking a great number
of questions. "Four thousand dollars is a heap
of money." He knitted his brows for a moment,
and then cast an anxious glance at Sam. "How
did Minnie really seem to take it?" he continued.</p>

<p>"She sided with you, Songbird, when her
father talked against you," answered Sam.</p>

<p>"She did, did she? Good for her!" and Songbird's
face lit up for an instant. "She's true
blue, that girl is!"</p>

<p>"Now, the best thing I think you can do is to
try to go to sleep and get a good night's rest,"
went on Sam. "This worrying about what can't
be helped won't do you any good."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but, Sam, what am I going to do if that
money isn't gotten back? The Sandersons can't
afford to lose it, and even if I went to work right
away, it would take me a long, long time to earn
four thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"I have been thinking that over, Songbird, and
as the money was to be used in paying off a mortgage,
I think I can arrange the matter, providing
the holder of the present mortgage won't extend
the time for it. I think I can get my father or
my uncle to take the mortgage."</p>

<p>"Very good, Sam, so far as it goes. But that
wouldn't be getting the money back. If it isn't
recovered, I'll feel that I am under a moral obligation
to earn it somehow and give it to Mr.
Sanderson."</p>

<p>"We'll talk about it later. Now you've got
to go to sleep," were Sam's concluding words,
and after that he refused to say any more. He
undressed and threw himself on his bed, and
was soon asleep. But poor Songbird turned and
twisted, and it is doubtful if his eyes closed until
well along in the early morning hours.</p>

<p>On the following day Sam had several classes
to attend, as well as to work on a theme; but as
soon as these tasks were over he obtained permission
to leave the college to find out, if possible,
if anything had been done in the matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the robbery. He visited Ashton and had an interview
with the police, and then used the telephone
in several directions. But it was all of
no avail; nothing whatever had been seen or
heard of the rascal who had made the attack
upon Songbird.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it will be one of those mysteries
which will never be explained," mused the youngest
Rover boy, as he jumped into the cutter
which he was using and drove away from Ashton.
"It's too bad! Oh! how I'd like to get
my hands on that rascal, whoever he may be!"</p>

<p>It was not until two days later, when Songbird
was once more able to be about and had insisted
on being driven over to the Sanderson place,
that Sam had a chance to go on the sleighride
with Grace Laning. He drove over to Hope
Seminary about four o'clock in the afternoon,
having sent word ahead that he was coming.
Grace was waiting for him, and the pair speedily
drove away, wistfully watched by a number of
the girl students.</p>

<p>"It's so nice of you to think of me, Sam, when
you've got so much to think about on poor Songbird's
account," said Grace, as they were speeding
out of the seminary grounds. "How is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's doing better than we expected, Grace.
He insisted on being driven over to the Sandersons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
this afternoon. Stanley took him over,
because none of us thought Songbird was strong
enough to drive himself."</p>

<p>"I want you to give me all the particulars of
the attack," said the girl, and this the youth did
readily.</p>

<p>"It must have been the man who stuttered and
whistled&mdash;the fellow Songbird saw at the
Knoxbury bank," declared the girl, positively.
"Wouldn't it pay to get a detective on his track?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, Grace. I think Songbird is going
to mention that to Mr. Sanderson."</p>

<p>Sam did not want the girl to worry too much
over what had occurred and so soon changed the
subject. They talked about college and seminary
matters, and then about affairs at home, and
about matters in New York City.</p>

<p>"I just got another letter from Nellie to-day,"
said Grace. "She says that the apartment she
and Tom have rented is perfectly lovely&mdash;every
bit as nice as the one occupied by Dick and
Dora."</p>

<p>"I'm glad they like it, Grace. But, believe me,
it will be some job for Tom to settle down and
be a staid married man! He was always so full
of fun."</p>

<p>"Why, the idea, Sam Rover! Don't you think
a man can be married and still keep full of fun?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, maybe, if he got such a nice girl as
Nellie. Just the same, I'll wager Tom sometimes
wishes he was back in good old Brill."</p>

<p>"Indeed! And do you think you'll wish you
were back at Brill if ever you get married?" she
asked slyly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't say anything about that, Grace.
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, it's just about the same thing," and
Grace tossed her pretty face a trifle.</p>

<p>"Oh, now look here, Grace! You haven't any
call to talk that way. I suppose when I get
married I'll be just as happy as Dick or Tom.
That is, providing I get the right girl," and he
gazed at the face beside him very ardently.</p>

<p>"Sam Rover, you had better watch where you
are driving, unless you want to run us into the
rocks and bushes," cried the girl, suddenly. For,
forgetting the steed for a moment, Sam had allowed
the horse to turn to one side of the somewhat
rough highway.</p>

<p>"I'll attend to the horse, never fear," he answered.
"I never yet saw the horse that I
couldn't manage. But speaking of letters, Grace,
I had one from Dick day before yesterday and
he made a suggestion that pleased me very
much."</p>

<p>"What was that?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"He suggested that if I graduate from Brill
this coming June, as I expect to do, that we make
up a party to occupy two or three automobiles
and go off on a regular tour this summer, taking
in the Middle West and maybe some other
points."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam, how grand! Of course he was going
to take Dora along?"</p>

<p>"Yes. His idea was that if matters could be
arranged at the offices in New York, that he and
Dora, as well as Tom and Nellie, would go along
and that we would go too, along with some others&mdash;say
enough to make at least two automobile
loads."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd love an auto tour like that! Couldn't
we have just the best times ever?" and Grace's
pretty eyes sparkled in anticipation.</p>

<p>"When I got the letter I thought the same, and
I also thought we might ask Songbird and Minnie&mdash;Dora
and Nellie could chaperon her, you
know. But now I don't know what we'll do
about them. Most likely Songbird wouldn't feel
like going if that money wasn't recovered, and
more than likely Mr. Sanderson wouldn't let
Minnie go."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I suppose the loss of that money
will hang over Songbird like a big cloud forever,"
pouted the girl. "It's too bad! I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
see why Mr. Sanderson couldn't have paid that
mortgage with a check."</p>

<p>"Just exactly what we all say now, Grace. But
that doesn't do any good."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you are going to graduate,
Sam?"</p>

<p>"I certainly hope so. I am going to try my
best not only to graduate, Grace, but to get as
close to the top of the class as possible. Dick
and Tom had to leave before they had a chance
to graduate, so I want to make a good showing
for the Rover family."</p>

<p>"It's the same with me, Sam. Nellie left to
get married, and so did Cousin Dora, so I've got
to do the best I can for our family next June."</p>

<p>"Then you hope to get through too?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"How are the teachers treating you these days?
Have you had any more trouble with Miss Harrow,
or the others?"</p>

<p>"Not the least bit. They are all perfectly lovely,
and Miss Harrow is so sorry that she ever
thought Nellie had taken that diamond ring."</p>

<p>"Well, she ought to feel sorry," responded
Sam. "It certainly put Nellie to a lot of trouble.
Did that gardener who put the diamond ring in
the inkwell ever come back to work at the seminary?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Andy Royce? Yes, he is working there. I
have seen him several times. He is quite a
changed man, and I don't think he drinks at all."</p>

<p>"Well, that's one good job done, Grace. That
man's worst enemy was liquor."</p>

<p>Sam had arranged that they might remain out
until nine o'clock that evening, and so drove
Grace over to Knoxbury, where they went to
quite a fashionable restaurant for dinner. Here
they met several young men and girls they knew,
and all had a most delightful time during the
repast.</p>

<p>When Sam went outside to get his horse and
cutter, which had been placed in a livery stable
near by, he was surprised to encounter the very
man he had mentioned but a short while before,
Andy Royce, the gardener who had once been
discharged from Hope Seminary for not attending
properly to his duties and who, through the
intercession of the Rovers and the Lanings, had
been reinstated in his position.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Rover," said Andy Royce,
respectfully, as he touched the cap he wore.</p>

<p>"Hello, Royce! What are you doing here?"
asked the youth.</p>

<p>"Oh, I just drove over to Knoxbury to get
some things for the seminary," replied Royce;
and then stepping closer he added in a lower tone:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
"I saw you going into Meeker's restaurant a
while ago and I stayed here to see you when
you came out. I'd like to talk to you a bit."</p>

<p>"All right. What have you to say?" returned
Sam, briskly. "I haven't got much time to
waste."</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you about the young fellow
who was knocked down and robbed the other
afternoon," went on Andy Royce, as the two
walked away, out of the hearing of the others
in the livery stable. "Somebody told me that the
fellow who was robbed said a man did it who
stuttered and whistled."</p>

<p>"Well, we rather think that man did it, but
we are not certain," answered Sam. He glanced
sharply at the gardener. "Do you know anything
of that fellow?"</p>

<p>"I think I do, Mr. Rover. You see it's this
way: Several years ago I used to live out West,
in Denver and Colorado Springs, and I used to
know a man out there who went by the name of
Blackie Crowden. He used to stutter fearfully
and had a funny little whistle with it."</p>

<p>"Out in Denver, you say? That's a long way
from here."</p>

<p>"I know it is, sir, but after I left I heard that
this Blackie Crowden had come to Center Haven,
and that's only twenty miles from here. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that ain't all," continued Andy Royce, earnestly.
"I was in this town about a week ago and I
am almost certain I saw this same Blackie Crowden
on the street. I tried to reach him so as to
speak to him, but he got away from me in a
crowd that had come up to see a runaway."</p>

<p>"This is interesting," returned Sam. "Tell me
how this Blackie Crowden looks," he went on.
And then as Andy Royce described the individual
he added slowly: "That seems to tally with
the description Songbird gave of the fellow who
looked at him through the bank window when
he was placing the money away. More than
likely that fellow was that same Blackie Crowden."</p>

<p>"Well, if it was Blackie Crowden, why don't
you have him locked up?" queried the gardener.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will, providing he is still in Center
Haven," answered Sam.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>SOMETHING ABOUT BLACKIE CROWDEN</h3>


<p>When Sam returned to Brill late that evening,
after having spent a most delightful time with
Grace, he found that Songbird had returned from
the Sandersons' homestead some time before.
The would-be poet of the college was working
hard over some of his lessons, and it was plainly
to be seen that he was in anything but a good
humor.</p>

<p>"Sanderson treated me like a dog&mdash;like a regular
dog!" he burst out, in reply to Sam's question.
"Why! to hear him talk you would almost
think I was in league with the fellow who attacked
me!"</p>

<p>"It's too bad, Songbird; but you shouldn't take
it so much to heart. Remember, Mr. Sanderson
is a very hard-working man and one who has
probably never allowed another fellow to get the
best of him in any kind of a deal. The amount
that was lost represents probably the savings of
a good many years, and to lose it so suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and in such an underhanded way has completely
upset him. When he has had time to think it
over calmly he'll probably see that you were not
to blame."</p>

<p>"I don't think so&mdash;he's not that kind of man,
Sam. He was very bitter and he told Minnie
that she wasn't to see me any more. Minnie
was dreadfully upset, of course, and she rushed
off to her room, so I didn't have any chance to
say good-bye to her."</p>

<p>"As bad as that, eh? Well, you can write her
a letter anyway."</p>

<p>"So I can; but maybe her father will see to
it that she never gets it," responded the smitten
youth, gloomily.</p>

<p>"I've got a little news that may prove encouraging,"
pursued Sam after a slight pause; and
then he related the particulars of his meeting
with Andy Royce, and what the Hope gardener
had said regarding Blackie Crowden.</p>

<p>"Say! that's great!" burst out the would-be
poet. "If I could see this Crowden I'd know at
once if he was the man who watched me when
I was at the Knoxbury bank, and if it was it
would certainly pay to put the authorities on his
trail."</p>

<p>"I was thinking the same, Songbird. I wonder
if we couldn't get permission from Dr. Wallington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to drive over to Center Haven to-morrow
and find out what we can about this Blackie
Crowden?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll have to give us permission&mdash;at least
he'll have to let me go," returned Songbird. "I
can't settle down to any lessons until something
is done, one way or another. Here I am, trying
to study, and I hardly know a word of what
I'm reading."</p>

<p>"Let us go to the doctor at once if he is still
up and ask him," said Sam.</p>

<p>Permission to leave the college was readily
granted by Dr. Wallington, who, however, cautioned
Songbird about overexerting himself
while he was still suffering from the attack that
had been made upon him.</p>

<p>"I'll depend upon you, Rover, to look after
him," said the head of Brill, kindly. "And let
me add, I wish you every success in your search
for the offender. I certainly would like to see
you get Mr. Sanderson's money back."</p>

<p>The two young collegians had breakfast as
early as possible, and by eight o'clock were on
their way to Center Haven in the automobile
belonging to the Rovers, and which had now
been left in Sam's care. Heavy chains had been
put on the wheels so that the automobile made
its way over the snowy roads without much trouble.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Of course in some spots where the frozen
highway was uneven, the boys got some pretty
hard bumps, but this they did not mind, their
one thought being to get to Center Haven as
soon as possible and learn all they could concerning
Blackie Crowden and his doings.</p>

<p>Center Haven was a town about the size of
Knoxbury, and among other things boasted of a
large hotel which was generally well patronized
during the summer months. Andy Royce had
said that Crowden had been seen at this hotel
and probably had some sort of position there.
When the boys arrived there they found that the
main building of the hotel was completely closed.
The only portion that was open was a small
wing with an equally small dining room used
for the accommodations of the few transients
who came to Center Haven during the winter
months.</p>

<p>"We came here to find a man named Blackie
Crowden," said Sam to the proprietor of the
hotel, who came forward to meet them when
they entered. "Can you tell me anything about
him?"</p>

<p>"You won't find him here," returned the hotel
man, brusquely. "I discharged him two weeks
ago."</p>

<p>"Discharged him?" queried Songbird, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
tone showed his disappointment. "Any trouble
with him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, lots of trouble. Are you friends of
his?"</p>

<p>"We certainly are not," answered Sam. "But
we'd like to find out something about him."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you are not friends of his," continued
the hotelkeeper. "I feel very sore over that
man. I took him in and gave him a good job,
and paid him a good deal more than he was
worth. But he wouldn't work&mdash;in fact he was
the laziest man I ever saw&mdash;and so I had to discharge
him. I paid him all that was coming to
him, and when he got out he was mean enough
to sneak off with some of my clothing, and also
a pair of my gloves and my rubbers. If I could
lay my hands on him, I'd be strongly tempted
to hand him over to the police."</p>

<p>"Did he take an overcoat of yours and a fur
cap?" demanded Songbird, quickly.</p>

<p>"He certainly did. A heavy, dark-gray overcoat
and one of these fur caps that you can pull
down over your ears and over the back of the
head."</p>

<p>"He must have been the same fellow," remarked
Sam. "And the fact that he robbed this
man here goes to prove what sort of rascal he
really is."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did he steal anything from you people?"
asked the hotelkeeper, curiously.</p>

<p>"I think he did," answered Songbird. "Did
you hear anything of the attack that took place
a few days ago on the road near Ashton, in
which a young fellow was robbed of four thousand
dollars in cash?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I heard about that from the police
captain here."</p>

<p>"Well, I am the fellow who was robbed," continued
Songbird. "And I'm strongly inclined to
think now that it was this Blackie Crowden who
was guilty&mdash;in fact I am almost certain of it.
When I was at the Knoxbury bank getting the
money and putting it away in my pocket I saw
a man watching through a window of the bank.
He had on a dark-gray overcoat and a fur cap
pulled far down over his face. Then, later on,
just after I was attacked, my friend here with
a chum of ours came driving along and saw this
same man with the heavy overcoat and the fur
cap drive off with the horse and cutter that I
had had&mdash;and he was the same fellow who had
knocked me senseless."</p>

<p>"Is that so! Well, I think you've hit the nail
on the head, and if you catch this Blackie Crowden
you'll have the right fellow. Anybody who
would run off with my things as he did after he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
had been treated as well as I treated him wouldn't
be above committing such a crime. But the
question is, where did he go? Have you any
idea?"</p>

<p>"We know he got on the train at Dentonville,"
said Sam. "That's as far as we've been able
to trace him so far. But now that we know that
this criminal is Blackie Crowden, maybe the authorities
will be able to run him down sooner or
later."</p>

<p>"This Crowden was very friendly with one or
two of the men around the stables," went on the
hotelkeeper. "Maybe you can find out something
about him from them."</p>

<p>"A good idea!" answered Songbird. "We'll see
what they have to say."</p>

<p>The hotel man took the two youths to the
stables, and there they talked with several men
present who had known Crowden. From these
they learned that the man had been very much
dissatisfied with the work assigned to him, and
had frequently spoken about the good times to
be had in such large cities as New York, Chicago
and Denver.</p>

<p>"He said he thought he would go back to New
York first," said one of the stable men, "and then
he thought he would go on to Chicago and after
that visit some of his old places and cronies in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Denver. But, of course, where he really did go
to I haven't the least idea."</p>

<p>"What you say is something of a clue anyway,"
returned Sam. "Now if we only had a
photograph of this Crowden, it might help the
police a great deal."</p>

<p>"We've got a picture of him," said one of the
men present. "It was taken by one of the visitors
at the hotel this fall. He came out here to
take a picture of some of the horses and we
helped him, so all of us got into the picture,
Crowden with the rest. I'll get it," he added,
and disappeared in the direction of his sleeping
quarters.</p>

<p>The photograph was a fairly large one, showing
three men and as many horses. The man in
the center was Blackie Crowden, and the stable
man and the hotelkeeper declared that it was an
excellent photograph of that individual.</p>

<p>"Will you let us have this photograph?" asked
Songbird. "I would like to have that picture of
Crowden enlarged, and then you can have it
back."</p>

<p>"Sure you can have it," answered the stable
man. "As that fellow is a thief, you might as
well tear that picture up afterward, because I
don't want to be in no photograph with a criminal,"
and he grinned sheepishly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right then, I won't take the trouble to
return it," answered Songbird. "Suppose you
accept this dollar for it," and he passed over a
banknote, which the stable man took with thanks.
A little later the two youths started on the return
to Ashton.</p>

<p>"Well, that's one step nearer the solution of
this mystery," announced Sam. "Now I think
we had better stop at Knoxbury and find out
about that horse which belonged to Hoover, the
livery stable man."</p>

<p>They reached the banking town about noon,
and went directly to the livery stable. As they
did so a man in a cutter drove in, leading a horse
behind him.</p>

<p>"There is the horse now!" cried Sam. "He
must have just gotten the animal back from
Mr. Bray."</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Hoover?" questioned Songbird
of the man in the cutter, as he came to a halt
near them.</p>

<p>"That's my handle, young man. What can
I do for you?"</p>

<p>"I would like to know something about that
horse, and who hired him from you;" and then
he introduced himself and Sam.</p>

<p>"I don't know who got the animal," answered
Mr. Hoover. "I was away at the time, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
stable boy let him out. He declares the fellow
said he was a friend of mine, and that it would
be all right."</p>

<p>"And was the fellow dressed in a heavy, gray
overcoat and a heavy fur cap?" asked Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was the description the stable boy
gave. When he found I didn't know anything
about the man he was scared to death, because
I told him that if the horse didn't come back
I'd make him pay for the animal."</p>

<p>"Then that's all we want to know, Mr.
Hoover," answered Songbird. "I'm pretty sure
now I know who it was that knocked me down
and robbed me."</p>

<p>"He was a rascal, all right," answered the livery
stable man. "I had to pay old Bray four
dollars to get my own horse back," he added,
sulkily.</p>

<p>As the long ride in the open air had made
them hungry, the two youths went to the restaurant
in Knoxbury for dinner. Then the automobile
was turned once more in the direction
of Ashton.</p>

<p>"I'll have that photograph enlarged by Clinger,"
said Songbird, referring to a photographer
in the town who did a great deal of work for the
Brill and Hope students. "Then I'll have copies
sent to the various police stations, even to New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
York, Chicago and Denver, along with a description
of Blackie Crowden."</p>

<p>"That's the talk, Songbird. Oh, I am sure
we'll get on his trail sooner or later," said Sam.
But though he spoke light-heartedly for his
chum's benefit, he knew that to trace the criminal
would be by no means easy. With the four
thousand dollars in his possession, Blackie Crowden
would probably make every effort to keep
from being discovered.</p>

<p>As they sped along the road, Songbird could
not help becoming poetical, and despite his blueness
he managed to concoct the following doggerel:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The engine hums&mdash;advance the spark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn on the throttle&mdash;what a lark!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away we go like a flash of light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the hill and out of sight."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Not so bad, Songbird," was Sam's comment.
"That's right&mdash;keep it up and maybe you'll feel
better." But that was the only verse to be gotten
out of the would-be poet for the present.</p>

<p>Arriving at Ashton, they went immediately to
the photographer's shop and told him what was
wanted, and he agreed to re-photograph the picture
of Crowden and then enlarge the same and
make as many copies as Songbird desired.</p>

<p>"I'll do it this afternoon," said Mr. Clinger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
"and you can have a dozen or more copies by
to-morrow morning. I'll make the head of the
fellow about as large as a half dollar, and that
ought to make a picture for any policeman or
detective to go by;" and so it was arranged.</p>

<p>While the youths were at the photographer's
an express train had come into Ashton and now
quite a few people were coming away from the
railroad station. As the boys walked towards the
automobile, Songbird suddenly uttered a cry.</p>

<p>"Look, Sam! Look who's here!"</p>

<p>"Why, it's Tom! My brother, Tom!" exclaimed
Sam, as he rushed forward. "What in
the world brought him here to-day?"</p>

<h3>IN WHICH TOM ARRIVES</h3>


<p>Tom Rover, tall and broad-shouldered, looked
the picture of health as he came toward his
younger brother and Songbird. He smiled broadly
as he shook hands with them.</p>

<p>"Why, Tom! What brings you here?" remarked
Sam. "You didn't write about coming
on."</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought I'd just drop in and surprise
you," returned Tom. "You know I can't quite
get used to being away from Brill," he continued,
with a grin.</p>

<p>"Want to get back to your studies, I suppose,"
was his brother's dry comment. "Well, come
ahead; you can help me on a theme I am writing
on 'Civilization in Ancient Central America.'"</p>

<p>"Wow! that sounds as interesting as a Greek
dictionary!" cried Tom. "Thank goodness! I
don't have to worry my head about themes any
more. But just the same, Sam, don't make any
mistake. I am as busy these days as I ever was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in my life, trying to help Dick and dad to put
our new organization on its feet."</p>

<p>"And how is that getting along?"</p>

<p>"Fine. We incorporated this week and have
our papers, and now I am the secretary of The
Rover Company," and Tom strutted around with
his thumbs under his arms. "Some class to me,
eh?"</p>

<p>"And what is Dick?" questioned Songbird, curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick is treasurer," answered Tom. "Dad,
of course, is president, but he expects to hold
that position only until Sam comes in. Then
Dick is to become president; myself, treasurer;
and Sam, secretary."</p>

<p>"Say! that's all right," responded the youngest
Rover, his face showing his satisfaction.</p>

<p>"That is, provided you want to come in, Sam.
Dad doesn't want you to give up your idea of
becoming a lawyer unless you want to."</p>

<p>"Oh, I might become a lawyer and remain
secretary of the company too," was the answer.
"One thing is sure, if you and Dick are going
to remain in that company you'll have to take
me in."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the news?" went on Tom. "Had
any fun lately? How is Grace?" and he looked
rather sharply at his brother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Grace is all right," answered Sam. He
hesitated a moment. "I suppose you didn't
get the letter I sent to you and Dick yesterday&mdash;the
letter about Songbird here?"</p>

<p>"Why no. I left the office night before last."</p>

<p>"Songbird is in trouble, Tom," returned the
brother. "Are you going up to the college? If
you are you can go with us in the automobile
and we'll tell you all about it on the way."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll go up, and I might as well take my
grip with me, for maybe I'll stay over until to-morrow
if they have room for me," and thus
speaking Tom turned back to the railroad station
to get his dress-suit case. The three youths
were soon on their way to Brill, and as Sam
manipulated the car he and Songbird gave the
new arrival the details concerning the attack.
Tom, of course, listened with deep interest.</p>

<p>"That's a rank shame, Songbird!" he cried, at
the conclusion of the narrative. "I know just
how you feel. If I could get my hands on that
Blackie Crowden, I think I'd put him in the hospital
first and in prison afterward."</p>

<p>"I told Songbird not to worry as far as the
money was concerned," went on Sam. "If that
old fellow who holds the mortgage won't wait
for his money, I told Songbird that I thought we
could get our folks to advance the cash."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure thing!" responded Tom, promptly.
"You give me the details and I'll see about the
money when I go back."</p>

<p>"Mr. Sanderson said he would know about
it early next week," answered Songbird. "He expects
a visit from old Grisley and Belright Fogg."</p>

<p>"My gracious! You didn't tell me anything
about Fogg being connected with this," burst out
Sam.</p>

<p>"I forgot all about it," answered Songbird.
"It seems that as soon as old Grisley heard
the money was stolen and that it wasn't likely
the mortgage would be paid, he hired Belright
Fogg to take the matter up for him. He is an
old man and very excitable, and he somehow
got the notion that Mr. Sanderson would try to
swindle him in some way. So he got Belright
Fogg in the case, though as a general thing he
has no more use for lawyers than he has for
banks."</p>

<p>"Well, he's very foolish to put his case in the
hands of such a fellow as Belright Fogg. Tom,
I guess you'll remember the trouble we had with
that fellow."</p>

<p>"I sure do, Sam!"</p>

<p>"And Sam had more trouble with him," cried
Songbird. "Don't forget how you hit him in
the head with a snowball."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's right. In the excitement of the attack
on you, Songbird, I forgot all about that,"
answered the youngest Rover. "I suppose he is
laying back to bring that up against me."</p>

<p>They soon reached the grounds surrounding
Brill, and Tom looked at the college buildings
with interest.</p>

<p>"Looks almost like home to me," he said somewhat
wistfully. "My, but I had some good times
here! I wish I had been on deck for that snowballing
contest."</p>

<p>"Sam was the hero of that occasion, according
to all accounts," answered Songbird. "He
captured the banners of the freshies and sophs,
you know."</p>

<p>As the automobile rolled into the grounds a
number of students recognized Tom and waved
friendly greetings to him. Leaping out, he was
soon surrounded by a number of his old chums,
all of whom wanted to know where he had been
keeping himself and how long he was going to
stay with them.</p>

<p>"Can't stay longer than to-morrow noon," he
announced. "You know I'm a business man
now," and he puffed up and grinned in a manner
that made all of the others smile.</p>

<p>"You just came in time, Tom," cried Spud.
"Your old friend, William Philander Tubbs, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
has been away on business to Boston, got back
here this morning."</p>

<p>"What! My old friend Tubby here? I'll be
glad to shake his flipper," announced Tom, and
grinned more than ever as he recalled the practical
jokes that had been played at different times
on the dudish student who had been mentioned.</p>

<p>Of course the students present wanted to know
what had been learned by Sam and Songbird on
the trip to Center Haven, and many were the
speculations regarding Blackie Crowden.</p>

<p>"The authorities ought to be able to catch that
fellow now that you have his photograph and a
good description of him," remarked Stanley. "It
would be a good idea to send that description
and photograph broadcast."</p>

<p>The boys reported to Dr. Wallington, and Tom
went with them. The head of Brill was glad to
see his former student, and readily consented to
allow Tom to remain with the others that night,
an extra cot being put into room No. 25 for that
purpose.</p>

<p>"Are those the banners you captured, Sam?"
questioned Tom, when the boys entered the room,
and as he spoke he pointed to two banners which
were nailed up on the wall.</p>

<p>"Yes, Tom, those are the ones we captured,"
was the reply of the youngest Rover, with considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
pride. "The freshies and sophs wanted
them back the worst way, but I told them there
was nothing doing, that I intended to keep them
at least until I graduated. They sent a committee
to me to get the banners, and I can tell you
that committee was pretty sore when they went
away without getting them."</p>

<p>"You watch out that they don't take those banners
on the sly, Sam."</p>

<p>"Oh, Songbird and I are looking out for them.
Didn't you notice we had the door locked? We
always lock up now, and no one has a key but
the janitor, and we have cautioned him not to
let any one in here without our permission."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'd like to do to-night," said
Tom. "I'd like to smuggle something to eat into
this room and give some of our crowd a spread,
just for the fun of it."</p>

<p>"All right, I'm willing, Tom," answered his
brother. "Of course you'll have to keep rather
quiet about it, because I don't want to get into
the bad graces of any of the monitors or of Dr.
Wallington. I want to graduate next June with
the highest possible honors."</p>

<p>It was arranged that while Songbird and Sam
studied some necessary lessons, Tom was to return
to Ashton in the automobile and bring back
a number of things which would be needed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the proposed spread. Tom took Spud and Stanley
with him. Out on the campus the three came
face to face with William Philander Tubbs.</p>

<p>"Hello, Tubblets, old boy!" cried Tom cordially,
as he caught William Philander by the
hand. "How are you making it these days?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash; How do you do, Rover?"
stammered the dudish student. "Why, I am&mdash;er&mdash;am
quite well, thank you. I thought you
had left college?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't leave it for good, you know,
Tubby, my dear. They wouldn't be able to get
along without me."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;ah&mdash;why&mdash;ah&mdash;somebody told me you
were going into business in New York."</p>

<p>"That's right, Tubbette."</p>

<p>"Oh, Rover! please don't call me by those
horrid nicknames any longer," pleaded William
Philander. "You promised me long ago you
wouldn't do it."</p>

<p>"Only a slip of my memory, my dear Philander
Williams. I really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no! Not Philander Williams. My name
is William Philander."</p>

<p>"That's right! so it is. It's always been
Philander William&mdash;No, I mean Willander Philiams&mdash;no,
that isn't it either. My gracious,
Tubblets, old boy! what have you done with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
front handles of your cognomen, anyway? You
twist me all sideways trying to remember it."</p>

<p>"Really, how odd! My name is William Philander
Tubbs. That's easy enough."</p>

<p>"If I had it engraved in script type on a visiting
card and looked at it daily, maybe I would
be able to remember it," answered Tom, mournfully.
"You know my head was never very good
for history or anything like that. However,
now that I know that your name is Philander
Tubblets Williams, don't you think you'd like
to ride down to Ashton with us? We are going
to have a little spread to-night, and I want you
to help me pick out the spaghetti, sauerkraut,
sweet potato pie, Limburger cheese, and other
delicacies."</p>

<p>"Oh, by Jove! do you really mean you are
going to have those things for a spread?" gasped
William Philander.</p>

<p>"That is, if they are just the things you like,"
returned Tom, innocently. "Of course, Stanley
here suggested that we have some fried eel sandwiches
and some worm pudding. But I don't
know about such rich living as that."</p>

<p>"Eel sandwiches! Worm pudding!" groaned
William Philander, aghast. "I never heard of
such things! Why don't you get&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;some
cream puffs and chocolate éclares and er&mdash;and&mdash;er&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
mint kisses and things like that, you
know?"</p>

<p>"Not solid enough, my dear Willie boy. The
boys love substantials. You know that as well
as I do. Of course we might add a few little
delicacies like turnips and onions, just for side
dishes, you know."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;really think you had better excuse me,
Rover!" exclaimed William Philander, backing
away. "I am not feeling extra good, and I don't
think I want to go to any spread to-night," and
William Philander bowed and backed still farther.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, Philly Willy," responded Tom,
dolefully. "Of course if you don't want to participate
you don't have to, but you'll break our
hearts if you stay away. Now you just come to
room twenty-five to-night and we'll give you the
finest red herring and mush ice cream you ever
chewed in your life," and then he and his chums
hurried away in the automobile, leaving William
Philander Tubbs gazing after him in deep perplexity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE FEAST</h3>


<p>When Tom came back accompanied by Stanley
and Spud, all had their arms full of the things
purchased in Ashton.</p>

<p>"And this is only the half of it," announced
the fun-loving Rover to his brother, in answer to
a query. "We've got to go back and get the rest
out of the automobile."</p>

<p>"We'll bring that stuff up," said Stanley. "You
stay here with your brother. Come on, Songbird,
I see you are doing nothing, so you might
as well give us a lift," and off the three boys
trooped to bring up the rest of the things purchased
for the feast.</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad you are going to give this,
Tom, on Songbird's account," announced Sam,
when he and his brother were left to themselves.
"Songbird is about as blue as indigo. You see,
it isn't only the money&mdash;it's Minnie. Her father
won't let him call on her any more."</p>

<p>"Tough luck, sure enough," responded Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
"Well, let us do all we can to-night to make
Songbird forget his troubles." Tom took a walk
up and down the room, halting in front of a picture
of Grace which was in a silver frame on a
chiffonier. "Pretty good picture, Sam," he observed.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is."</p>

<p>"Did you say that you had been out with
Grace lately?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. We had a fine sleighride only the
other day."</p>

<p>"She's made quite a friend of a Miss Ada Waltham
at the seminary, a rich girl, hasn't she?"</p>

<p>"She has mentioned Miss Waltham to me. I
didn't know that they were particularly friendly,"
answered Sam. "You know this Miss Waltham
is very rich."</p>

<p>"So I heard, Sam. She is worth about a quarter
of a million dollars, so somebody said. But
she has a brother, Chester, who is worth even
more. An uncle died and left nearly his entire
estate to the brother."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Lucky young fellow! But I
don't see how that interests me, Tom," and Sam
looked at his brother inquiringly. "You act as
if you had something on your mind."</p>

<p>"So I have, Sam; and that is one of the reasons
I came here to-day," announced Tom. "I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
tell you about it in the morning," he added hastily,
as a tramping was heard in the hallway;
and the next moment the door burst open and
in came Stanley, Songbird, Spud and one or two
others, all loaded down with bundles and packages.</p>

<p>"Make way for the parcels post and the express
company!" proclaimed Spud, as he dropped
several packages on one of the cots. "Say, Tom,
you must have bought out half of Ashton."</p>

<p>"Only three-eighths, Spud," answered the fun-loving
Rover, gaily. "You see I knew what an
awful appetite you had, and as I had an extra
twenty-five cent piece in my jeans I thought I'd
try to satisfy that appetite just once."</p>

<p>"Twenty-five cents! Wow!" commented Stanley.
"I'll wager this spread costs you a good
many dollars."</p>

<p>Word had been passed around to a number of
Tom's old friends, and they were all requested
to be on hand by ten o'clock.</p>

<p>"Tubbs says he begs to be excused," announced
Paul Orben when he came in. "He says
he has got some studying he must do."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! He's afraid we'll treat him to
some sauerkraut pie and some pickled pastry,"
returned Tom. "I don't want him to stay away
and miss a good time. What room is he in?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Number eighteen."</p>

<p>"Then come along, some of you, and we'll
bring him here," announced the fun-loving Rover,
and marched off, followed by Spud and Bob.
In the meanwhile, Sam, Songbird and Stanley
brought the things from the closet and began to
prepare for the feast.</p>

<p>Tom and his friends found William Philander
busy folding and putting away half a dozen gorgeous
neckties. He was rather startled at their
sudden entrance, and did his best to hide the articles.</p>

<p>"Hello! I thought you were boning away
on trigonometry or mental science," was Tom's
comment. "Say, old boy, that's a gorgeous necktie,"
he added as he picked up a creation in
lavender and yellow. "Did you buy this to wear
at the horse show, or at a meeting of mothers'
helpers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Rover, please don't muss that
up!" pleaded William Philander, snatching the
necktie from Tom's hands. "That is one that
was&mdash;er&mdash;made&mdash;er&mdash;a&mdash;a present to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. That's the one that blind young
lady gave to you. I admire her taste in picking
it out."</p>

<p>"Blind lady? I&mdash;er&mdash;have no blind lady
friend," returned William Philander.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember now, Tubby, she was
deaf&mdash;not blind. It's a wonder she didn't pick
out something a little louder."</p>

<p>"Oh, Rover, I really believe you are poking
fun at that necktie," returned the dudish student.</p>

<p>"We came to get you to come to the feast,
Willie," announced Spud. "We don't want you
to miss it."</p>

<p>"We wouldn't have you miss it for a peck of
shelled popcorn," put in Bob.</p>

<p>"Yes, but really, I've got some studying to do,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can study after the feast is over, my dear
boy," broke in Tom, as he caught William Philander
by the arm. "You'll be surprised how
much quicker you can learn on a full stomach
than on one that is half vacant. Come on!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We haven't any time to spare, Tubblets. You
are going to the feast, so you might as well make
the best of it. Come on, fellows, help him along.
He's so bashful he can't walk," and thus urged,
Spud took William Philander's other arm while
Bob caught him by the collar and in the back,
and thus the three of them forced the dudish
collegian out of his room and along the hallway

<p>By this time something like fifteen students
had gathered in the room, and the advent of Tom
and his chums with the somewhat frightened
William Philander was greeted with a roar of
approval. The dudish student was marched in
and made to take a seat on a board which had
been placed on two chairs. On the board sat
several students, and William Philander was
placed on one end.</p>

<p>"Now, then, everybody make himself at home,"
announced Tom, as soon as a look around had
convinced him that his brother and the others
had everything in readiness for the feast. "I believe
you'll find everything here except toothpicks,
and for those we'll have to chop up one
of Sam's baseball bats later on."</p>

<p>"Not much! You're not going to touch any
of my bats," announced the younger brother,
firmly.</p>

<p>"Sam wants to keep them to help bat another
victory for Brill this spring," put in Spud. "My!
but that was one great game we had last season."</p>

<p>"So it was," put in another student. "And
don't forget that Tom helped to win that game
as well as Sam."</p>

<p>While this chatter was going on various good
things in the way of salads and sandwiches had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
been passed around, and these were followed by
cake and glasses of root beer, ginger ale and
grape juice.</p>

<p>"Why, this is perfectly lovely," lisped William
Philander Tubbs, as he sat on the end of
the board-seat, his lap covered with a paper napkin
on which rested a large plate of chicken salad
and some sandwiches. In one hand he held an
extra large glass of grape juice.</p>

<p>"Everybody ready!" announced Stanley, with
a wink at several of the boys. "Here is where
we drink to the health of Tom Rover!"</p>

<p>"Tom Rover!" was the exclamation, and at
a certain sign all the boys seated on the board
except William Philander leaped to their feet.</p>

<p>The result was as might have been expected.
The dudish pupil had been resting on the end
of the board, which overlapped the chair, and
with the weight of the others removed, the board
suddenly tipped upward and down went William
Philander in a heap, the chicken salad jouncing
forward over his shirt front and the glass of
grape juice in his hand being dashed full into
his face.</p>

<span class="caption">THE BOARD SUDDENLY TIPPED AND DOWN WENT WILLIAM

</div>

<p>"Hi! Hi! What&mdash;er&mdash;did&mdash;er&mdash;you do that
for?" he spluttered, as he sat on the floor, completely
dazed. "Say! why didn't you tell me
you were going to get up?" and then he started
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>to wipe the grape juice from his eyes and nose.</p>

<p>"Hello! Salad's going down!" cried one student
gaily.</p>

<p>"Say, Tubbs, there is no use of throwing such
nice food as that away even if you don't want
it," chimed in another.</p>

<p>"Don't you know enough to stand up when a
toast is to be drunk?" queried a third.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;didn't quite understand," stammered
William Philander, and then with an effort he
extracted himself from the mess on his lap and
slowly arose to his feet. "My gracious! I believe
I have utterly ruined this vest and trousers!"
he added mournfully, as he gazed down at the
light gray suit he wore.</p>

<p>"Oh, a little gasoline will fix that up all right,"
said Spud. "Don't let a little thing like that interfere
with your pleasure, Tubbs. Come on&mdash;here's
another glass of grape juice. No use of
crying over spilt milk&mdash;I mean juice," corrected
the youth.</p>

<p>"Tom Rover! Everybody up!" came the call,
and then amid a subdued murmuring of good
luck the boys stood around Tom and drank his
health.</p>

<p>"Thank you, fellows, very much," answered
Tom, and there was just a suspicion of huskiness
in his voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Speech! Speech! Give us a speech!" came
from several.</p>

<p>"Speech? Great guns! I never made a speech
in my life," announced Tom, and now for the
first time he looked a bit confused.</p>

<p>"Oh, you've got to say something, Tom," cried
Stanley.</p>

<p>"What shall I talk about&mdash;earthquakes in India,
or the spots on Tubbs' pants?" queried Tom,
with a grin.</p>

<p>"Never mind what you talk about so long as
you say something," came from Bob.</p>

<p>"All right then&mdash;here goes!" announced Tom
after a little pause. "Catch this before it's too
late. I'm glad to be here, otherwise I wouldn't
be here. I'm glad you are here, otherwise you
wouldn't be here. I think Brill College is the
best college any fellow could ever go to, if that
hadn't been so I'd never have gone to Brill.
I'm sorry I couldn't stay here to graduate, but
I've left the honor to Sam here, and I trust he'll
get through and make a record for the whole
family. Boys, I thank you from the bottom of
my heart. And here's wishing you all success
at graduation and success through life," and thus
concluding his little speech, Tom took a generous
drink of ginger ale, while the others applauded
vigorously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very good!" cried Sam, but then added quickly:
"For gracious sake! don't make too much
noise or you'll have one of the monitors here and
we'll get some black marks."</p>

<p>"That's right, fellows," announced Stanley.
"After this we'll have to be as noisy as a mouse
in a cheese factory."</p>

<p>"Now that I have been called on to make a
speech," announced Tom, after quietness had been
restored, "I am going to call on Songbird for
one of his choice bits of poetry."</p>

<p>"Oh, now, Tom! please don't do that," pleaded
the would-be poet of Brill. "You know I'm
in no humor for writing poetry now."</p>

<p>"All the more reason why you should write
some," announced Sam. "Come on now. You
must have something tucked away in your system&mdash;I
mean something brand new."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;I've got something new, but I
hardly think it is appropriate for this occasion,"
answered Songbird slowly.</p>

<p>"Never mind; give it to us no matter what it
is," cried one of the students.</p>

<p>"Let her flutter!"</p>

<p>"Poetry for mine!"</p>

<p>"Let her flow, Songbird!"</p>

<p>"That's right. Turn on the poetry spigot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Songbird;" and thus urged the would-be poet of
Brill began:</p>

<h3>TOM FREES HIS MIND</h3>


<p>The party in Number 25 did not break up
until some time after midnight, and all present
declared that they had had the time of their
lives. Only one interruption had come, made
by a good-natured monitor who had begged them
to make less noise, and this fellow, well known
to Tom, had been bought off with several sandwiches
and a bottle of ginger ale.</p>

<p>"And how do you fellows feel this morning?"
asked Tom, who was the first to get up after a
sound sleep.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm first rate," announced his younger
brother. "I thought I'd dream, with so much
chicken salad and sandwiches and cake in me,
but I slept like a log."</p>

<p>"I didn't sleep extra well," came slowly from
Songbird. "But I don't think it was the feast
kept me awake."</p>

<p>Tom walked over to where the would-be poet
of Brill sat on the edge of a cot and dropped
down beside him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Songbird, you take the loss of that money
too much to heart," he said kindly. "Of course
we all know it was a great loss. Yet it won't
do to grieve over it too much. And besides, there
is hope that some day the authorities will catch
that Blackie Crowden and get at least part of the
money back."</p>

<p>"It isn't the money alone, Tom; it is the way
Mr. Sanderson has treated me. And besides that,
I'm worried over that mortgage. I'd like to
know just what old Grisley and his lawyer are
going to do."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do, Songbird. If you
wish me to, I'll call on Mr. Sanderson and tell
him what we are willing to do, so that he can
rest easy about paying the mortgage off if he
has to."</p>

<p>"I wish you would go, Tom&mdash;and put in a
good word for me, too," cried Songbird, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll do that, never fear. I'll go this
morning before I start back to New York;" and
thus it was arranged.</p>

<p>"You said that you had something to tell me,
Tom," remarked Sam, as the three were going
downstairs to breakfast. "What was it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it may not amount to much, Sam. I'll
tell you about it as soon as we can get by ourselves,"
answered Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The morning meal was quickly disposed of,
and then Tom and Sam returned to Number 25,
the former to repack his dress-suit case before
leaving for the Sandersons' place and for New
York.</p>

<p>"I don't exactly know how to get at this,
Sam," began his brother, slowly, when the pair
were in the bedroom and the door had been
closed. "It is about Grace and the Walthams."</p>

<p>"About Grace?" and Sam showed his increased
interest. "What about her?"</p>

<p>"Well, as I mentioned last night, this Ada
Waltham is very rich, and she has a brother,
Chester, who is older than she is and much richer.
In fact, I've heard it said that he is a young
millionaire."</p>

<p>"Well?" queried Sam, as his brother paused.</p>

<p>"Oh, I really don't know how to get at this,
Sam," burst out Tom, and his face showed his
worry. "Maybe there is nothing in it at all; but
just the same I thought I had better bring it
to you at once. I knew you would rather have
it come from me than from some outsider."</p>

<p>"But what in the world are you talking about,
Tom?"</p>

<p>"I'm talking about the attentions this Chester
Waltham is bestowing upon Grace. It seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that his sister, Ada, introduced him to Grace a
couple of months ago, and since that time I've
heard that he has been up to Hope several times,
ostensibly to call on his sister, but really to see
Grace. I understand he has taken both of them
out riding several times."</p>

<p>"Taken Grace out riding!" cried Sam, and
his face flushed suddenly. "Are you sure of this?
Grace never mentioned it to me."</p>

<p>"I think it's the truth, Sam. You see, ever
since Nellie left Hope she has kept corresponding
with several of the girls there, and one of
these girls knows Ada Waltham quite well, and
she mentioned the fact of the sister and Grace
going out with Chester. She said that she quite
envied Grace being invited to ride out with a
young millionaire. Then Nellie spoke to Dora
about it, and Dora said she had heard practically
the same thing from another one of the seminary
students. Now I don't like to butt in, Sam,
but at the same time I thought you ought to
know just how things were going."</p>

<p>"I don't understand it at all," returned the
younger brother, and for the moment he looked
rather helpless. "If Grace received an invitation
to go out with this Chester Waltham, I am quite
sure she would mention it to me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she merely went as a companion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Ada's," suggested Tom, "and she might have
thought it wasn't necessary to mention it."</p>

<p>"Have you heard anything more than that,
Tom?"</p>

<p>"Not much, except that in one of the letters
this girl said that she would envy Grace all the
nice flowers and boxes of candy she might expect
from such a wealthy young man as Waltham.
Now, as I said before, Sam, it's none of my
business, but I just couldn't help coming out here
to put a flea in your ear. We&mdash;Nellie and I&mdash;know
just how you feel about Grace, and both
of us would like nothing better than to have you
double up with her after you graduate."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Tom; it's fine for you to talk
that way, and it's fine to have Nellie on my side.
But I don't understand this at all. If Grace has
been going out with this Chester Waltham, why
hasn't she said something to me about it? She
has spoken to me about Ada a number of times,
but I never heard this Chester mentioned once."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't tell you any more than I have
told you," returned Tom. "If I were you, I'd
see Grace and find out just what this fellow has
been doing. You know a fellow who is worth
a million dollars is some catch for any girl."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. It's a good deal more than
I'll be able to offer Grace."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"True, but money isn't everything in this life,
Sam. I didn't look for money when I married
Nellie, and I don't think she cared a rap how
much I was worth."</p>

<p>"That's the way it ought to be done&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I always supposed that you and Grace had
some sort of an understanding between you,"
went on Tom, after rather an awkward pause.
"Of course, Sam, you haven't got to say a word
about it if you don't want to," he added hastily.</p>

<p>"We did have some sort of an understanding,
Tom. But you know how it was with you and
Nellie&mdash;Mrs. Laning wouldn't think of your becoming
publicly engaged until after you had left
college. She has told Grace that she will have
to wait. So she is free to do as she chooses."</p>

<p>There was but little more that could be said on
the subject, and so Tom turned to pack his suit
case while Sam got ready to attend one of his
classes. The youngest Rover heaved a heavy
sigh, which showed that he was more disturbed
than he cared to admit.</p>

<p>A little while later Tom had said good-bye to
his brother and to his numerous friends at Brill
and was on his way in a hired turnout to the
Sanderson homestead, which he had promised
to visit before leaving on the train at Ashton
for New York City. Tom went on his errand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
alone, none of the others being able to get away
from the college that morning.</p>

<p>The Sandersons had heard nothing about his
arrival at Brill and, consequently, were much surprised
when he drove up. Minnie greeted him
with a warm smile, and even Mr. Sanderson,
considering his great loss, was quite cordial.</p>

<p>"Ain't comin' back to complete your eddication,
are you, Mr. Rover?" questioned the farmer,
with a slight show of humor.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Sanderson. I'm through with Brill
so far as studying goes," answered the youth. "I
just took a run-out to see how Sam and the
others were getting along. They told me all
about your loss, and I'm mighty sorry that the
thing happened. Poor Songbird is all broke up
over it."</p>

<p>"Humph! I reckon he ain't half as much broke
up as I am," retorted the farmer. "This has
placed me in a fine pickle."</p>

<p>"Now, Pa, please don't get excited again,"
pleaded Minnie, whose face showed that she had
suffered as much, or more, as had her parent.</p>

<p>"Ain't no use to get excited now. The money
is gone, and I suppose that is the last of it. What
I'm worryin' about is how I'm goin' to settle
about that mortgage. Grisley at first said he
would put it off, but yesterday he sent word that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
he was comin' here to-day with his lawyer to
settle things."</p>

<p>"And here they come now!" interrupted Minnie,
as she glanced out of a window. The others
looked and saw two men drive up the lane in a
cutter. They were old Henry Grisley, the man
who held the mortgage on the farm, and Belright
Fogg. The girl went to the door to let the visitors
in. Old Henry Grisley paid scant attention
to Tom when the two were introduced to each
other. The lawyer looked at the visitor in some
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Huh! I didn't expect to see you here, Mr.
Rover," said Belright Fogg, coolly. "Are you
mixed up in this unfortunate affair?"</p>

<p>"I may be before we get through," answered
Tom.</p>

<p>"You weren't the young man who lost the
money?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I've got an account to settle with your
brother," went on Belright Fogg, rather maliciously.
"He took great pleasure the other day
in hitting me in the head with a snowball, almost
knocking me senseless. I've had to have my head
treated by a doctor, and more than likely I'll sue
him for damages."</p>

<p>"I reckon you'll do what you can to make it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
hot for him," returned Tom. "It's your way,
Mr. Fogg. But just let me give you a word of
advice&mdash;you take care that you don't get your
fingers burnt."</p>

<p>"Ha! Is that a threat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. It is only a word of advice. Please
to remember that we know all about you, and
we won't stand any nonsense from you. If my
brother really hurt you, he'll be willing to do
the fair thing; but if you think you can gouge
him in any way, you've got another guess coming."</p>

<p>"Looky!" came in a shrill voice from old
Henry Grisley. "I thought we come here fer my
money on that er mortgage," and from under
a pair of heavy gray eyebrows he looked searchingly
into the faces of Mr. Sanderson and the
lawyer.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Grisley, that's what we came for,"
returned Belright Fogg, "and the sooner we
come to business perhaps the better."</p>

<p>"As I've told you before, the money is gone&mdash;stolen,"
said Mr. Sanderson. "I can't pay&mdash;at
least not now, and I'd like an extension of
time."</p>

<p>"Mr. Grisley isn't inclined to grant any extension,"
said Belright Fogg, somewhat pompously.
"The mortgage is too big for this place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
anyway, and he feels that he ought to have his
money."</p>

<p>"And if Mr. Sanderson can't pay, what then?"
questioned Tom, before the farmer could speak.</p>

<p>"Why, we'll have to foreclose and sell the
place," answered the lawyer, quickly.</p>

<p>"That's it! That's it!" came shrilly from old
Henry Grisley. "I want my money&mdash;every cent
of it. If I don't git it, I'm goin' to take the
farm," he added in tones which were almost triumphant.</p>

<p>"But see here&mdash;&mdash;" began Mr. Sanderson.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pa, don't let them sell the farm!" burst
out Minnie, and as she spoke the tears started
to her eyes.</p>

<p>"You won't sell the farm, Mr. Grisley," said
Tom, coolly.</p>

<p>"Why not, if the money isn't paid?" cried
the old man.</p>

<p>"The money will be paid&mdash;every cent of it,"
answered Tom.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>OLD GRISLEY COMES TO TERMS</h3>


<p>All in the room looked at Tom in some surprise
because of the plain way in which he had
spoken.</p>

<p>"Mr. Rover, you are sure of what you are
saying?" questioned Mr. Sanderson, quickly, in
a low voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Sanderson, we'll take care of this
mortgage. Don't you worry a bit about it."</p>

<p>"Did you say you would pay off this mortgage?"
demanded Belright Fogg, glaring at Tom.</p>

<p>"I didn't say I'd pay it off personally. But my
folks will take care of it."</p>

<p>"The money is due now&mdash;has been due for
several days."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's right!" came shrilly from
Henry Grisley. "And I want you to know that
I want the full amount with interest up to the
day when it is paid. I ain't goin' to lose nothin'&mdash;not
a cent."</p>

<p>"Mr. Grisley, I have an offer to make to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
you," went on Tom addressing himself directly
to the old man and utterly ignoring Belright
Fogg. "You don't know me, but let me say
that my father and my uncle are worth a good
deal of money. I am in business in New York
with my father, and our concern has a great
deal of money to invest. Now, if you will agree
to hold this mortgage for thirty days, I will
guarantee to have it paid in full at that time
with every cent of interest. And in addition
to that I will pay you twenty-five dollars for
your trouble and for your lawyer's fees."</p>

<p>"Ha! What do you think I am? What do
you think I work for?" demanded Belright
Fogg, with a scowl. "My fee will be more than
twenty-five dollars in this case."</p>

<p>"What? What?" shrilled Henry Grisley,
turning his beadlike eyes on the lawyer. "Twenty-five
dollars? Not much! I'll give ye ten dollars
and not a cent more."</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk, Mr. Grisley. You
give him ten dollars and you keep the fifteen
dollars for your own trouble," cried Tom. "So
far as I can see he hasn't done anything for you
excepting to come here to see Mr. Sanderson,
and certainly such a trip as this isn't worth more
than ten dollars."</p>

<p>"My services are worth a good deal more!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
exclaimed Belright Fogg. And thereupon ensued
a war of words between him and Henry Grisley
which lasted the best part of a quarter of
an hour. The lawyer saw the case slipping away
from him, and at last in deep disgust he said he
would have no more to do with the affair.</p>

<p>"Don't want ye to! Don't want ye to!" piped
out Henry Grisley. "Lawyers are a useless expense
anyway. I'll settle this case myself, and
for what you've done I won't pay more'n ten
dollars, jest remember it!" and he shook a long,
bony finger in Belright Fogg's face.</p>

<p>"I won't be insulted in this manner!" cried
the lawyer, and then in a dudgeon he stormed
from the house, leaped into the cutter, and drove
away.</p>

<p>"A good riddance to him," murmured Mr.
Sanderson. But then he added hastily: "Was
that your horse, Grisley?"</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't," was the answer. "And how
I'm to git home now, I don't know," added the
old man, helplessly.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?" questioned Tom.</p>

<p>"The other side of Ashton, on the Millbury
road."</p>

<p>"All right, then, I'll take you there when I
go down to the depot," answered Tom. "That
is, if you want to ride with me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to know jest how we stand on this
mortgage question first," announced Henry
Grisley. "I want your offer down in black and
white."</p>

<p>"You shall have it, and the others can be witnesses
to it," answered Tom, and in the course
of the next quarter of an hour a paper was
drawn up and duly signed by which Tom agreed
that the mortgage should be taken over by the
Rovers within the next thirty days, with all
back interest paid, and that Henry Grisley should
be paid a bonus of twenty-five dollars for his
trouble and for his lawyer's fees. To bind the
bargain Tom handed the old man a ten-dollar
bill on account, which Henry Grisley stowed
away in a leather wallet with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom! it's just splendid of you to help
us out in this manner!" said Minnie, after the
transaction had been concluded and while old
Grisley and Mr. Sanderson were talking together.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to be of service to you," answered
the youth. "I only hope for your sake, and for
the sake of Songbird, that the money that was
stolen is recovered. Songbird is going to get
on the trail of that rascal if it is possible to
do so."</p>

<p>"I hope they do locate that fellow, Tom. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
they don't I'm afraid pa will never forgive poor
John."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that, Minnie. 'Never' is such
a long word it should not have been put in the
dictionary," and Tom smiled grimly.</p>

<p>Now that he felt fairly certain that he was to
get his money, Henry Grisley was in much better
humor.</p>

<p>"I suppose I might as well have left that mortgage
as it was," he mumbled. "It was payin'
pretty good interest."</p>

<p>"Well, that was for you to decide, Grisley,"
returned Mr. Sanderson. "Personally I don't
see how you are going to make any better investment
in these times."</p>

<p>"Well, I've got thirty days in which to make
up my mind, ain't I?" queried the old man. "If
I don't want to close out the mortgage I ain't
got to, have I?"</p>

<p>"Certainly you've got to sell out, now that you
have bargained to do so," put in Tom. "You
can't expect us to pull our money out of another
investment to put it into this one and then not
get it."</p>

<p>"Hum! I didn't think o' that," mused old
Grisley. He thought hard for a moment, pursing
up his lips and twisting his beadlike eyes
first one way and then another. "Supposin' I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
was to say right now that I'd keep the mortgage?
What would you do about it?"</p>

<p>"Do you really mean it, Grisley?" asked Mr.
Sanderson, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Depends on what this young man says, Sanderson.
One thing is sure; I ain't goin' to give
up that ten dollars he give me&mdash;and Fogg is got
to be paid somehow."</p>

<p>"Look here! if you want to keep the mortgage
just say so," declared Tom. "It's a good mortgage
and pays good interest. You can't invest
your money around here to any better advantage."</p>

<p>"All right, then, I'll keep the mortgage," announced
Henry Grisley. "But understand,
young man, I'm to keep that ten dollars you give
me too," he added shrewdly.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see&mdash;&mdash;" began Tom, when
Mr. Sanderson interrupted him.</p>

<p>"All right, Grisley, you keep the ten dollars,
and you settle with Fogg," announced the farmer.
"And it's understood that you are to make
out the mortgage for at least one year longer."</p>

<p>"Can't ye give me more'n the ten dollars?"
asked Henry Grisley. "Mebbe I might have to
pay Fogg more'n that."</p>

<p>"Don't you pay him a cent more," said Tom.
"His services aren't worth it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't pay him nothin' if I can git out of
it," responded the old man, shrewdly. "If I
keep the mortgage, then what has he done for
me? Nothin'. Mebbe I'll give him half of the
ten dollars. I've had jest as much trouble as
he has."</p>

<p>Following this discussion the paper formerly
drawn up was destroyed and a note written out
and signed by Henry Grisley, in which the old
man agreed to renew the mortgage for one year
from the date on which it had been due.</p>

<p>"To tell ye the truth, I wouldn't have bothered
about this," explained old Grisley, in a
burst of confidence; "but, you see, Fogg knew
the mortgage was due and he come to me and
asked me what I was goin' to do about it. And
then when word come that your money had
been stolen, he told me that I'd better foreclose
or otherwise I might git next to nothin'."</p>

<p>"The underhanded rascal!" was Mr. Sanderson's
comment.</p>

<p>"That's just what he is," answered Tom.
"You know we had a lot of trouble with him
last year&mdash;and evidently we are not done with
him yet," he added, as he thought of what Belright
Fogg had said concerning the snowball
thrown by Sam.</p>

<p>Tom wanted to say a good word for Songbird,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and the opportunity came when, a few minutes
later, and before their departure, Minnie
invited them to partake of some cake and hot
coffee. While Grisley sat down in the dining-room,
the youth talked to the farmer.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Sanderson, I have done what I
could for you," he said, coming at once to the
point; "and now I want to say a word or two
about poor Songbird. He feels awfully bad
over this matter, and he thinks that you are
doing him an injustice. And let me say I think
so too," and Tom looked the farmer squarely
in the eyes as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, Rover, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Sanderson, supposing you had
been in Songbird's place and had been knocked
down and nearly killed; what would you say if
you were treated as you are treating him?
Wouldn't you be apt to think that it was a pretty
mean piece of business?"</p>

<p>At these plain words the farmer flushed and
for the instant some angry words came to his
lips. But then he checked himself and turned
his eyes away.</p>

<p>"Maybe you are right, and maybe I was a
bit hasty with the lad," he said hesitatingly.
"But you see I was all worked up. It took me
a good many years to save that four thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
dollars, and now that I am getting old it won't
be no easy matter for me to save that amount
over again."</p>

<p>"You won't have to save it over again, Mr.
Sanderson. Songbird insists upon it that just
as soon as he gets to work he's going to pay you
back dollar for dollar."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you that?"</p>

<p>"He did. And he told the others the same
thing. He'll make that loss up to you if it
takes him ten years to do it. I've known him
for a good many years now. We went to Putnam
Hall Military Academy together before we
came to Brill&mdash;and I know he is a fellow who
always keeps his word. He's one of the best
friends we Rover boys have. He's a little bit
off on the subject of poetry, but otherwise he's
just as smart and sensible and true-blue as they
make 'em," went on Tom, enthusiastically. "And
not only that, he comes from a very nice family.
They are not rich, but neither are they
poor, and they are good people to know and be
connected with," and Tom looked at the farmer
knowingly.</p>

<p>"I see, Rover." Mr. Sanderson drew a deep
breath, and then looked through the doorway to
where Minnie was pouring out the coffee. "If
I was too hasty I&mdash;I&mdash;am sorry."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you will let Songbird come here and
call on your daughter?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I suppose so, if Minnie wants him to
come."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Sanderson. I am sure you
won't regret your kindness," said Tom, and insisted
upon grasping the farmer's hand and shaking
it warmly. Then he went in to have some
cake and coffee before taking his departure with
old Grisley.</p>

<p>"So you are going back to New York, are
you, Tom?" said the girl while he was being
served.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am going to take the train this afternoon,"
he answered, and then continued: "I've
got a loose button here on my coat, Minnie. Will
you fasten it before I go?"</p>

<p>"Sure I will," she returned, and a few minutes
later led the way to a corner of the sitting-room,
where was located a sewing basket.</p>

<p>"I wasn't worrying much about losing the button,
Minnie," he whispered. "I wanted to tell
you about Songbird. I have just spoken to your
father about him, and he says he can come to
see you the same as he used to."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom! did he really say that?" and Minnie's
eyes brightened greatly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did. And as soon as I get to Ashton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
I am going to send Songbird a telephone message
to that effect," returned Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom! will you?" and she looked at him
pleadingly.</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know, Minnie. And believe
me, Songbird, when he gets that news, will
be the happiest fellow in Brill."</p>

<p>"I don't think he'll be any happier than I'll
be," answered the girl; and then of a sudden
blushed deeply and finished sewing on the button
without another word.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Tom bade the Sandersons
good-bye, and, accompanied by Henry Grisley,
drove away in the direction of Ashton. Old
Grisley was left at his home, and then Tom
took himself to the depot, where, from a telephone
booth, he sent a message to Songbird
telling the would-be poet of Brill how it had
come about that Grisley had agreed to renew
the mortgage for one year, and how Mr. Sanderson
had said that Songbird could renew his
calls upon Minnie if he so desired.</p>

<p>"Tom, you're a wonder!" said Songbird over
the telephone, "you're a wonder, that's all I can
say!"</p>

<p>"Never mind what I am," returned the fun-loving
Rover, kindly; "you just see if you can
get on the trail of that fellow who stole the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
four thousand dollars, and at the same time you
get busy and make up for lost time with Minnie.
Good-bye!" and then he hung up the receiver,
and a few minutes later was on board
the train bound for the metropolis.</p>

<h3>SAM ON THE ROAD</h3>


<p>The next few days were very busy ones for
Sam because he had a number of important
classes to attend, and he was hard at work finishing
his theme on "Civilization in Ancient Central
America." It was impossible to call on
Grace, and so he did nothing to find out the
truth about Chester Waltham because he did
not wish to ask the girl about this over the telephone,
nor did he see his way clear to expressing
his thoughts on paper.</p>

<p>Sunday came and went, and Monday morning
brought a letter to the youngest Rover which
he read with much interest. It was from Belright
Fogg, a long-winded and formal communication,
in which the lawyer stated that he had
been under medical treatment because of being
hit in the head by a snowball thrown by Sam,
and he demanded fifty dollars damages. If the
same was not paid immediately, he stated that
he would begin suit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anything wrong, Sam?" questioned Songbird,
who was present while Sam was reading
the letter. "You look pretty serious."</p>

<p>"Read it for yourself, Songbird," was the
reply, and Sam passed the communication over.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the gall!" burst out the would-be
poet of Brill. "Fifty dollars! Of course you
won't pay any such bill as this?"</p>

<p>"Not so you can notice it," returned Sam,
sharply. "If he had sent me a bill for five dollars
or less I might have let him have the money
just to shut him up. But fifty dollars! Why,
it's preposterous!"</p>

<p>"What do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>"I won't do anything just yet. I want time
to think it over and to talk it over with some of
the others and, maybe, with Dr. Wallington."</p>

<p>When they heard of this demand for money
from the rascally lawyer, Stanley and Spud were
as angry as the others.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he's entitled to a cent," came
from Stanley. "We were having that snowballing
contest on the college grounds, and while
the highway runs through that end of the
grounds, I believe Fogg passed through there at
his own peril, as a lawyer might put it. If I
were you, Sam, I'd put the whole case up to Dr.
Wallington, and I'd remind the doctor of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
former trouble with Fogg, and let him know
just what sort of an underhanded rascal he is."</p>

<p>"All right, Stanley, I'll do it," answered Sam.
"I'll go to the doctor immediately after classes
this afternoon. Will you go along?"</p>

<p>"Of course, if you want me to."</p>

<p>Four o'clock found them at the door of the
doctor's study. He looked at them rather curiously
as they entered.</p>

<p>"Well, young men, what can I do for you?"
he questioned pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I've got into some trouble over that snowballing
contest," answered Sam; and, sitting
down, he gave the head of Brill the particulars
of the occurrence, and then produced the letter
received from Belright Fogg.</p>

<p>"Hum!" mused the worthy doctor, as he
knitted his eyebrows. "He must have been pretty
badly hurt."</p>

<p>"I don't think he was hurt at all, Doctor,"
interrupted Stanley. "I was present, and so
were a number of the other students. Mr. Fogg
had his hat knocked off, and that was about all.
He wasn't stunned or anything like that. He
talked to Sam just as rationally as I am talking
to you, and all those standing around heard him.
Of course, he was very angry, not only because
he had been hit but because the fellow who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
thrown the snowball was Sam Rover. He, of
course, remembered how the Rovers foiled his
plot to do them out of what was coming to them
when their flying machine was wrecked on the
railroad, and also how they got the best of Fogg
and a company of brokers in New York City."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I remember about the wrecked flying
machine," returned Dr. Wallington. "I
know nothing about this affair in New York."</p>

<p>"Well, it was a very serious matter, and Fogg
came pretty close to going to prison," answered
Sam, and gave a few details, as already related
in the volume entitled "The Rover Boys in New
York."</p>

<p>"Very interesting, Rover, very interesting indeed,"
murmured the head of Brill. "But even
that did not excuse your hitting this man in
the head with a snowball and hurting him."</p>

<p>"There is another point I would like to mention,"
said Stanley. "We were having the contest
on the college grounds, and Mr. Fogg was
struck on the roadway where it runs through our
grounds."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see. That might make a difference.
The highway is more or less of a public one, it
is true, but it has never been turned over to the
county authorities, so it really forms a part
of our grounds still. But of one thing I wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
to be sure, Rover&mdash;did you aim at Mr. Fogg, or
was the snowballing unintentional?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see him at all," answered Sam.
"Some of the fellows rushed behind the bushes
and I simply let drive along with a number of
others. Then Fogg appeared and claimed that
I had hit him in the head. I rather think he
tells the truth, although I am not positive."</p>

<p>"In that case he would have to prove that
you were guilty. Besides that, if it came to a
matter of law, he would have to prove actual
damages, and I do not see how he could claim
fifty dollars if he was not hurt more than you
say. If you wish, you can leave the whole matter
in my hands and I will have it investigated."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, Doctor Wallington,"
returned Sam, warmly. "This lifts a load off
my mind. Of course I will pay whatever you
settle on;" and so the matter was allowed to
rest.</p>

<p>A thaw had set in and the snow began to disappear
rapidly from the roads and fields around
Brill. There was a good deal of slush, which
rendered some of the highways almost impassable,
so that it was not until a week later that
Sam had an opportunity to visit Hope. In the
meantime, however, he had sent a nice little note
to Grace in which no mention was made of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Walthams. He had looked for an answer but
none had come.</p>

<p>"Where bound, Sam?" questioned Songbird,
when he saw his roommate getting ready to use
his automobile.</p>

<p>"I'm going for a run to Hope. Do you want to
come along?" and Sam's eye had a twinkle in it.</p>

<p>"You might run me around to the Sanderson
place. It won't take long in the auto," returned
the would-be poet. "If I can get there, I won't
mind walking back this evening. I've been wanting
to go for a long while, but the roads have
been so poor I couldn't make it."</p>

<p>"All right, Songbird, come ahead," was Sam's
answer; and a little later found the pair on the
road.</p>

<p>It did not take long to reach the Sanderson
farm, and as they entered the lane Sam tooted
his horn loudly.</p>

<p>"I've brought you a visitor, Minnie!" cried the
Rover boy, as he brought the machine to a standstill.
"Here is somebody I know you won't
want to see, but I'm going to leave him here
nevertheless," and he grinned broadly.</p>

<p>"Oh, John!" burst out the farmer's daughter,
and blushed deeply. She came forward and
shook hands with both youths. "I am more
than glad to see you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am on my way to Hope, so I won't come in,"
went on Sam. "How is everything, Minnie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about as usual," answered the girl, and
then went on: "Of course you know all about
what Tom did for us? It was splendid!"</p>

<p>"You haven't heard anything more regarding
the money?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing, Sam. I thought maybe you had
something to tell," and the girl turned from Sam
to Songbird.</p>

<p>"We have sent out the photographs and the
description of Blackie Crowden," answered the
latter. "They are going to the police in all the
large cities, so if Crowden turns up at all he'll
be arrested sooner or later."</p>

<p>After a few more words Sam left the Sanderson
place and headed directly for Hope.</p>

<p>Although he would not admit it even to himself,
the youngest Rover was a good deal worried.
What Tom had told him concerning Grace
and the Walthams had been continually in his
mind, and time and again he had wondered how
he should broach the subject to Grace and what
the answer of the girl would be.</p>

<p>"Of course she's got a right to go out with
whom she pleases," he told himself. "But still
I thought&mdash;well I thought it was all fixed between
us, that's all."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Sam was so occupied with his thoughts that
he paid scant attention to the running of the
automobile. As a consequence he went over a
number of sharp stones, and a minute later there
came a loud report from the rear of the machine.</p>

<p>"A blowout! Confound the luck!" he exclaimed,
as he brought the automobile to a standstill.
"And just when I was in a hurry to get
to Hope!"</p>

<p>There was nothing else to do, so, stripping
himself of his overcoat and donning a jumper,
Sam got out, taking with him some of the tools
from under the automobile seat. It was a tire
on one of the rear wheels which had blown
out, and this wheel he now jacked up for the
purpose of putting on a new shoe and inner tube.
As luck would have it, the tire that had been
cut fit very tightly, so that it was all the Rover
boy could do to get it off the rim. He tugged
and twisted, perspiring freely, but it was some
time before he could even get the injured shoe
started.</p>

<p>"If I can't get it off, what ever am I to do?"
he mused. "I must be at least half a mile from
even a telephone, and the nearest garage is at
Ashton. At this rate I'll never get to Hope."</p>

<p>He continued to work over the tire, at last
doing his best to pound it off with a bit of iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and a hammer. Then he gave a final wrench,
which brought the tire off so suddenly that Sam
was sent flat on his back in the dirt and slush
of the road. It was an occurrence to try anybody's
patience, and Sam arose in anything but
a happy frame of mind. His back was covered
with mud, and a good deal of the slushy water
had penetrated to his skin.</p>

<p>"Ugh! of all the rank luck!" he muttered, as
he shook himself. "If I ever get this wheel
mended I'll be a fine sight to present myself at
a fashionable ladies' seminary. Why in the
world didn't I look where I was driving, instead
of rushing right over such a prime collection
of rough stones?"</p>

<p>But finding fault with himself did not mend
matters, and so, casting the cut tire aside, Sam
unstrapped one of the extra shoes he carried
and got out another inner tube.</p>

<p>As if everything was to go wrong that afternoon,
the new shoe proved to be as small as
that which had been taken off, and as a consequence
Sam had to work like a Trojan for the
best part of half an hour before he finally got
it into place.</p>

<p>"And now I've got to pump it up by hand," he
observed to himself, grimly, as he remembered
that the power pump which had been installed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
on the engine was out of order and could not
be used. Then he brought out the hand pump
and set to work to fill the new tire with air.</p>

<p>Sam had the tire about three-quarters pumped
up and was working away as vigorously as his
somewhat exhausted condition would permit
when he heard a honking of an automobile horn,
and the next moment a machine came in sight
around a turn of the highway. The car was a
large and powerful one of foreign make, and
was driven by a young man stylishly dressed,
in a full suit of furs, and wearing automobile
goggles. Behind him were two young ladies, also
wearing furs, and with veils covering their faces.</p>

<p>"Tough luck!" sang out the young man at
the wheel of the passing car, and he waved one
hand pleasantly towards Sam.</p>

<p>The youth had been bending over the hand
pump, but now, as the other automobile swept
by, he straightened up suddenly and stared with
open eyes after the vanishing turnout. He had
not recognized the young man who was running
the machine, but he had recognized the two
young ladies in the tonneau of the car.</p>

<p>"Ada Waltham! And that was Grace with
her!" he murmured. "And if that's so, it must
have been Chester Waltham who was running the
car!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>DAYS OF WAITING</h3>


<p>As Sam gazed after the vanishing automobile
a pang of bitterness swept through his heart. He
remembered all that his brother had told him
concerning Chester Waltham, and he also remembered
that Grace had never mentioned the
young millionaire.</p>

<p>"And she knew I was coming over to Hope
just as soon as the roads made it safe and pleasant
for automobiling," he murmured to himself.</p>

<p>Neither of the young ladies in the tonneau of
the car had looked back, so it was more than
likely they had not recognized him as he was
bending over the hand pump, inflating the new
tire.</p>

<p>"But maybe she saw me after all and did not
want to let on," he thought dismally. "Maybe
she thought I wouldn't recognize her."</p>

<p>What to do next was a problem for the young
collegian. If Grace was not at the seminary he
had no desire to call there. He continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
work over the tire, and soon it was properly
inflated, and he put away the tools he had used.
His face was a study, for he was doing some
hard thinking.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go to Hope anyway, and if she
isn't there I'll leave my card, so she'll know
I called. Then I'll see what she has to say about
matters," he told himself; and setting his teeth
somewhat grimly he started up the automobile
and continued his trip.</p>

<p>At the door of the seminary he was met by a
maid, who brought him the information that
Miss Laning was out. Then several girls who
knew Sam came up, and one of them explained
that Grace had gone automobiling.</p>

<p>"She went with Ada Waltham and her brother,
Chester," explained the girl student. "You see,
Chester has a brand new foreign car&mdash;a beauty&mdash;and
he was very anxious to give his sister and
Grace a ride. We thought he might have asked
some of us to go along, but he didn't," and the
girl pouted slightly.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose they were going to stop at
Brill?" questioned Sam, struck by a sudden
thought.</p>

<p>"I don't think so, Mr. Rover. Ada said something
about riding to Columbia and having dinner
there this evening. That, you know, is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
a distance, and the road doesn't run past your
college."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose they won't be back till late?"</p>

<p>"They had permission to stay out until ten
o'clock," put in another of the girls who were
present.</p>

<p>"Oh! I see." As the girls were looking at
him rather sharply, Sam felt his face begin to
burn. "Well, I hope they have a good time,"
he added somewhat hastily. "Good-evening,"
and then turned and walked quickly towards his
automobile; and in a minute more was on his
way back to Brill.</p>

<p>"I'll wager Grace Laning has got herself into
hot water," was the comment of one of the girls,
as they watched Sam's departure. "I don't believe
he likes it one bit that she went off with
the Walthams."</p>

<p>"Humph! You can't expect a girl to hang
back when she is asked to take a ride in a brand
new automobile, and with such millionaires as
Chester Waltham and his sister," broke in another
girl. "I just wish I had the chance," she
added rather enviously.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Sam was driving along the
country road in rather a reckless fashion. His
mind was in a turmoil, and to think clearly just
then seemed to be out of the question.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course she has a right to go out and dine
with the Walthams if she wants to," he told
himself. "But at the same time&mdash;&mdash;" And
then there came up in his mind a hundred reasons
why Grace should have refused the invitation
and waited for him to call upon her.</p>

<p>"Hello! you are back early," remarked Spud,
when Sam appeared at Brill. "I thought you
were going to make an evening of it."</p>

<p>"I had some bad luck on the road," replied
Sam, rather sheepishly. "I had a blowout, and
in trying to get the tire off I slipped and went
flat on my back in the mud and slush," he continued.</p>

<p>"Is that so? Well, that's too bad, Sam. So
you came home to get cleaned up, eh? I thought
your girl thought so much of you that she
wouldn't care if you called even when you were
mussed up," and at this little joke Spud passed
on, much to the Rover boy's relief.</p>

<p>The only occupant of Number 25 who seemed
to be happy that night was Songbird, who came
in whistling gaily.</p>

<p>"Had a fine time with Minnie," he declared&mdash;"best
time I ever had in my life. I tell you, Sam,
she's a wonderful girl."</p>

<p>"So she is, Songbird."</p>

<p>"Of course, you don't think she's half as wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
as Grace," went on the would-be poet of
Brill; "but, then, that's to be expected."</p>

<p>"How did Mr. Sanderson treat you?" broke
in Sam, hastily, to shift the subject.</p>

<p>"Oh, he treated me better than he did before."
Songbird's face sobered for a minute. "To be
sure he feels dreadfully sore over the loss of
that four thousand dollars. But I assured him
that I and the authorities were doing all in our
power to get the money back, and I also assured
him that if it wasn't recovered I expected
to pay it back just as soon as I could earn it.
Of course he thinks I am talking through my
hat about earning such a big amount, but just
the same I am going to do it just as soon as I
graduate from Brill. I'd go to work to-morrow
instead of staying here if it wasn't that I had
promised my folks that I would graduate from
Brill, and as near the top of my class as I could
get. If I left now, my mother would be heartbroken."</p>

<p>"Of course your folks know about the loss,
Songbird?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I wrote them the whole particulars
just as soon as I could, and I've let them know
what we are doing now."</p>

<p>"Do they blame you for the loss?"</p>

<p>"My father thinks I might have been a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
more careful, but my mother says she thinks
it is Mr. Sanderson's fault that he let me get
such an amount of money in cash and carry it
on such a lonely road. But dad is all right, and
in his last letter he said he could let Mr. Sanderson
have a thousand dollars if that would
help matters out."</p>

<p>"Had Mr. Sanderson heard any more from
old Grisley, or Belright Fogg?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He saw Grisley and the old man said
the lawyer was boiling mad because he had
agreed to let the mortgage run for another year.
Fogg wouldn't accept the five dollars that old
Grisley offered him for his trouble, so then Grisley
would give him nothing; and there the matter
stands."</p>

<p>"He'll get something out of Grisley if he possibly
can. My opinion is, since Fogg lost his
job with the railroad company, and made such
a fizzle of his doings in New York City, he is
in bad shape financially and eager to get his
hands on some money in any old way possible."</p>

<p>"Have you settled the snowball affair with
him yet?"</p>

<p>"No. I'm going to see Dr. Wallington about
it to-morrow," answered Sam.</p>

<p>The Rover boy had rather expected some sort
of a communication from Grace the next day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and he was keenly disappointed when no letter
came and when she failed to call him up on the
telephone. Several times he felt on the point
of calling her up, but each time set his teeth
hard and put it off.</p>

<p>"It's up to her to say something&mdash;not me,"
he told himself. "She must know how I feel
over the affair."</p>

<p>When Sam called upon Dr. Wallington, the
head of Brill met him with rather an amused
smile.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want to see me in regard to
that claim of Mr. Fogg's," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I have had one of the professors call
on the lawyer and bind him down to just exactly
what happened and how badly he was hurt.
It seems that he did not go to any doctor at all,
although he did see a friend of his, a Doctor
Slamper, on the street."</p>

<p>"Doctor Slamper!" cried Sam. "Oh, I remember
him. He's the fellow who came here
with Mr. Fogg at the time we put in our claim
for damages on account of the wrecked biplane."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! I remember," and Dr. Wallington
nodded knowingly.</p>

<p>"And what does Mr. Fogg want us to do?"
questioned Sam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"At first, as you know, he wanted fifty dollars.
Then he came down to twenty-five, and at last
to fifteen. Then we brought to his attention
the fact that the snowballing contest had taken
place on the college grounds, and that it was his
own fault that he had become mixed up in the
affair. This brought on quite an argument, but
in the end Mr. Fogg agreed to accept six dollars,
which he said would pay for three consultations
with Dr. Slamper at two dollars per
consultation," and the good doctor smiled rather
grimly.</p>

<p>"And did you pay the six dollars, Doctor?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, Rover. I expected, however, to
send him a check for that amount to-morrow,
provided you are satisfied."</p>

<p>"I think I'll have to be, Dr. Wallington. I
suppose it's rather a cheap way out of the difficulty,
although as a matter of fact I don't believe
he is entitled to a cent."</p>

<p>"You may be right, Rover. But six dollars,
I take it, is not so very large a price to pay for
so much fun&mdash;I mean, of course, the fun of the
snowballing contest in which, so they tell me,
you were the one to capture the banners of the
opposition."</p>

<p>"You're right, sir. And I'm satisfied, and
you can place the amount on my bill," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Sam; and then he bowed himself out of the doctor's
office.</p>

<p>Another day passed, and still there came no
word to Sam from Hope. He was very much
worried, but did his best not to show it.</p>

<p>"Call for all baseball candidates at the gym
to-morrow afternoon!" announced Bob, during
the lunch hour.</p>

<p>"I don't think I want to go in for baseball
this spring," returned Sam.</p>

<p>"I heard something of that from some of
the other fellows, Sam," interrupted Bob. "It
won't do. We need you and we are bound to
have you."</p>

<p>The roads were now drying up rapidly, and
that afternoon Spud asked Sam if he did not
want to walk to Ashton.</p>

<p>"I've got a few things I want to get at the
stores," said Spud. "Come along, the hike on
the road will do you good."</p>

<p>"All right, Spud, I'll go along, for I am tired
of writing themes and studying," answered Sam.
But it was not his theme and his lessons that
worried the boy. Thinking about Grace, and
waiting continually for some sort of word from
her, had given him not only a heart ache but
a headache as well.</p>

<p>When the boys arrived at Ashton they separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
for a short while, Spud to get fitted with
a new pair of shoes while Sam went to another
place in quest of a new cap. The Rover boy
had just made his purchase, and was leaving
the store to rejoin Spud when he heard some
one call his name, and looking around saw Andy
Royce approaching.</p>

<p>"I just thought I'd ask you if you had heard
anything about that Blackie Crowden yet," remarked
the gardener from Hope, as he approached.</p>

<p>"Not yet, Royce. But they have sent out a
good description of him, along with copies of
his photograph, so the authorities think they will
get him sooner or later."</p>

<p>"I've heard something that maybe you would
like to know," went on Andy Royce. "I've heard
that Crowden was over at Leadenfield, to a small
roadhouse kept by a man named Bissette, a
Frenchman."</p>

<p>"When was this?" demanded Sam, with interest.</p>

<p>"Either the day of the assault or the day
after. Bissette didn't seem to know exactly. I
happened to be there buying some potatoes for
the seminary&mdash;you see Bissette is a kind of agent
for some farmers of that neighborhood. I mentioned
the robbery to him and spoke about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
suspicion about Crowden, and he was very much
surprised. He said Crowden was there for a
couple of hours using the telephone, and then
he left the place when somebody drove up in
a cutter."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that Crowden went off with
the other person in the cutter?"</p>

<p>"Bissette thinks so, although he ain't sure,
because as soon as Crowden went out, Bissette
turned to do some work inside and forgot all
about him."</p>

<p>"Did Bissette have any idea who the man in
the cutter was?"</p>

<p>"He wasn't sure about that either, but he kind
of thought it was a lawyer who used to work
for the railroad company&mdash;a man named Fogg."</p>

<h3>BASEBALL TALK</h3>


<p>"Fogg!" cried Sam, in astonishment. "Do
you mean Belright Fogg?"</p>

<p>"That's the man&mdash;the fellow who used to do
the legal work for the railroad here."</p>

<p>"Was this Bissette sure it was Fogg?"</p>

<p>"No, he wasn't sure, because he didn't pay
very much attention. But he said if it wasn't
this Fogg, it was some one who looked very
much like him," answered Andy Royce.</p>

<p>This was all he could tell Sam of importance,
and the Rover boy went off, to rejoin his chum
in a very thoughtful mood.</p>

<p>"That's rather a queer state of affairs," was
Spud's comment, when told of the matter. "If
Fogg met this Blackie Crowden, what do you
suppose it was for?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the least idea, Spud."</p>

<p>"Do you think he was mixed up in this robbery?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't say that. The assault was committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
by one man, and so far they haven't
been able to find any accomplices."</p>

<p>When Sam returned to Brill he at once sought
out Songbird and told him of what he had heard.
The would-be poet of Brill was even more surprised
than Spud had been.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't put it above Belright Fogg to
be in with a rascal like Blackie Crowden," was
Songbird's comment. "He did his best against
you in that flying machine affair and in that affair
in New York City."</p>

<p>"I've got an idea," said Sam, after a slight
pause. "I am to pay him six dollars' damages
for hitting him in the head with that snowball.
Doctor Wallington was going to send him a
check. I've got a good notion to ask the doctor
to let me pay the bill and get Fogg's receipt for
it. That will give me a chance to pump him
about this matter."</p>

<p>"Do it, Sam! And I'll go along," burst out
his chum, quickly. "If this Belright Fogg knows
Blackie Crowden I want to know it."</p>

<p>Permission was readily granted by the head
of Brill to Sam to pay the bill, and that evening
the Rover boy and Songbird took the former's
automobile and rode over to where Belright
Fogg boarded, on the outskirts of Ashton. They
found the lawyer just preparing to go out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
he showed that he was very much surprised to
see them.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are here to pay that bill you
owe me," he said stiffly to Sam.</p>

<p>"I am, Mr. Fogg," was the answer. "I believe
you agreed to accept six dollars. If you will
make out a receipt for the amount I will give
you Doctor Wallington's check."</p>

<p>"Humph! isn't the check receipt enough?" demanded
the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But I would prefer to have a receipt
showing exactly what the money is being
paid for," answered Sam. "As a lawyer you
must know it is best to have these things
straight."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. Come in and I'll write out
your receipt for you," announced Belright Fogg,
coldly, and ushered the pair into a sitting-room.</p>

<p>Sam had asked Songbird to say nothing about
Blackie Crowden until the matter of the snowball
injury was settled. A receipt for the money
was quickly penned by Belright Fogg.</p>

<p>"There, I presume that will be satisfactory,"
he said, as he showed it to Sam.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Mr. Fogg," was the answer.
"And here is your check." Sam paused for a
moment while the lawyer looked the check over.
"By the way, Mr. Fogg, I understand you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in Leadenfield a few days ago at the tavern
kept by Bissette."</p>

<p>"What's that?" shot out the lawyer, somewhat
startled.</p>

<p>"I said that I understood that you were in
Leadenfield a few days ago at the tavern kept
by Bissette."</p>

<p>"And that you met a man there named Blackie
Crowden," broke in Songbird, quickly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I was in Leadenfield some days ago on
business," answered Belright Fogg, hesitatingly,
"but I wasn't at the Bissette place, or anywhere
near it."</p>

<p>"But you met a man named Blackie Crowden?"
queried Sam.</p>

<p>The lawyer glared at the Rover boy and also
at Songbird.</p>

<p>"Blackie Crowden? I don't know such an
individual&mdash;at least, not by name."</p>

<p>"He is a fellow who used to work in Hoover's
livery stable in Center Haven&mdash;a man who stutters
greatly."</p>

<p>"Don't know the fellow," was the prompt response.</p>

<p>"You mean to say you didn't meet Blackie
Crowden at Bissette's?" cried Songbird.</p>

<p>"Look here, young man, what are you driving
at?" stormed Belright Fogg, in a sudden temper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
"You've no right to question me in this manner.
What is it all about?"</p>

<p>"We have it on good authority that you met
this man, Blackie Crowden, outside of Bissette's
place," answered Sam, stoutly.</p>

<p>"Who is this man you mention?"</p>

<p>"Being a lawyer and interested in public affairs,
you ought to know that, Mr. Fogg," answered
Songbird. "He is the man who, we
think, knocked me down and robbed me of Mr.
Sanderson's four thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Ah! I&mdash;I remember now. And so you are
trying to connect me up with that rascal, are
you? What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Never mind what we mean," declared the
would-be poet of Brill, stoutly. "I want to get
at the facts in this matter. If you say you didn't
meet Crowden, all right, we'll let it go at that.
But there are others who say you did meet
him."</p>

<p>"It's false&mdash;absolutely false!" roared Fogg, but
as he spoke his face paled greatly. "I&mdash;I don't
know this fellow, Crowden&mdash;never met him in
my life. This is all a put-up job on your part
to make trouble for me," and he glared savagely
at both Songbird and Sam.</p>

<p>"It's no put-up job, Mr. Fogg. We intend to
get at the bottom of this sooner or later," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Sam, as calmly as he could. "Come on,
Songbird."</p>

<p>"See here! you're not going to leave this house
until I know just what you are driving at,"
roared the lawyer. "I won't have you besmirching
my fair name!"</p>

<p>"Your fair name!" returned Sam, sarcastically.
"There is no necessity for you to talk that
way, Mr. Fogg. I know you thoroughly. If
you want to rake up the past you can do it, but
I advise you not to do so."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" began the lawyer, and then
stopped, not knowing how to proceed.</p>

<p>"We might as well go," broke in Songbird.
"But perhaps, Mr. Fogg, you haven't heard the
end of this," added the would-be poet of Brill;
and though the lawyer continued to storm and
argue, the two chums left the house and were
soon on the return to Brill.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we didn't gain anything by that
move," was Sam's comment, as they rode along.
"He'll be on his guard now, and that will make
it harder than ever to connect him with this
affair&mdash;provided he really is mixed up in it."</p>

<p>"He acted pretty startled when we put it up
to him," returned Songbird. He heaved a deep
sigh. "Well, maybe some day this matter will
be cleared up, but it doesn't look like it now."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Several days passed, and Sam stuck to his lessons
as hard as ever. Once or twice he thought
of calling up Grace at Hope or of writing her
a note, but each time he put it off, why, he could
not exactly explain even to himself. But then
came a rift in the clouds and the sun shone as
brightly as ever. A note came from Grace, which
he read with much satisfaction. A part of the
communication ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>"I was thinking all manner of mean things
about you because you did not answer my note
of last week, when&mdash;what do you think? The
note came back to me, brought in by one of the
smaller girls here, Jessie Brown. Jessie was
going to town that day, and I gave her the note
to post and she put it in the pocket of her coat,
along with several other letters, so she says. Well,
the pocket had a hole in it, and, as you might
know, my own particular letter had to slip
through that hole into the lining of the coat.
The rest of the letters were mailed, but my letter
remained in the lining until this morning,
when Jessie came to me with tears in her eyes
to tell of what had happened. I felt pretty angry
over it, but glad to know that you were not
guilty of having received the note and then not
answering it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the note I told you how sorry I was to
find that you had called here while I was away.
You see, Ada Waltham's brother, Chester, came
on in his new automobile&mdash;a big foreign affair,
very splendid. He wanted to give Ada a ride,
and invited me to go along, so I went, and we
had a very nice time. Chester is an expert
auto driver, and the way we flew along over the
roads was certainly marvelous. He insisted upon
it that we dine with him. And, oh, Sam! such
a spread as it was!</p>

<p>"You know he is a millionaire in his own right
(Ada has a great lot of money too). We certainly
had one grand time, and I shall never
forget it. He got a beautiful bouquet for the
table, and also bouquets for Ada and me to take
home, along with boxes of the most beautiful
chocolates I ever ate. But just the same, I am
awfully sorry I wasn't at the seminary when
you called, and I don't understand why you
haven't been up since, or why you didn't telephone
to me.</p>

<p>"One of the girls here says they are organizing
the Brill baseball nine for the coming season,
and that they want you to play as you did last
year. If you do join the nine, I hope you have
the same success or more. And you can rest
assured that I will be on the grandstand to offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
you all the encouragement possible. I hope that
Dick and Tom come on to see the game and
bring Dora and Nellie along, and then we can
have the nicest kind of a jolly party. Ada Waltham,
as you may know, loves baseball games
too, and she says that she is going to have Chester
here at that time to take her over to Brill,
unless somebody else turns up to accompany
her."</p></blockquote>

<p>"All right, as far as it goes," mused Sam, on
reading this note. "But I wish Chester Waltham
would stay away. Of course I can't blame Grace
for liking a ride in a big, foreign car and being
invited out to such a first-class spread as she
mentions, but, just the same, I wish she wouldn't
go with him."</p>

<p>However, the communication brightened his
thoughts considerably, and it was only a little
while later when he talked to the girl over the
telephone and made an arrangement for a ride
in the automobile on the following Saturday
afternoon, Songbird and Minnie to accompany
them.</p>

<p>The four went off to Center Haven, where
Sam spread himself on a dinner which was certainly
all that could be desired. Grace was in
one of her most winning moods, and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
young couple parted the cloud that had hovered
over them seemed to be completely dispelled.</p>

<p>As winter waned and the grass on the campus
took on a greener hue, baseball matters came
once more to the fore at Brill. Bob Grimes,
who played at shortstop, was again the captain
of the team, and it was generally understood
that Spud Jackson would again occupy the position
of catcher.</p>

<p>"We're going to miss Tom Rover a good deal
this year," said Bob to some of the others. During
the year past Tom had been the candidate
for head twirler against both Bill Harney and
Dare Phelps and had shown that he was the
superior of both of the others.</p>

<p>"Well, you haven't got Tom Rover, so you've
got to make the best of it," answered Stanley.
"Phelps has been doing pretty well, I understand,
so you might as well give him a chance."</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought I'd do that," answered the
team captain. "Harney isn't in it at all, and
doesn't want even to try. I'll give Phelps a
chance and also Jack Dudley." Dudley was a
sophomore whose swift pitching had become the
general talk of the college. He, however, was
rather erratic, and liable to go to pieces in a
crisis.</p>

<p>As my old readers know, Sam had joined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
team the year before only after considerable
coaxing, and then merely as a substitute. During
the middle of the great game he had been
assigned to left field in place of a player who
had twisted his foot. In that position he had
caught a fly in a thoroughly marvelous manner,
and he had also managed, when at the bat, to
bring in a home run.</p>

<p>"We've simply got to have you on the team,
Sam," said the captain, a little later, when he
caught the Rover boy in one of the corridors.
"Your hanging back this year is rather hurting
our chances of winning."</p>

<p>"But, Bob, I want to pay attention to my lessons,"
pleaded Sam. "I can't afford to get behind."</p>

<p>"You'll not get behind," was the answer.
"Aren't we all striving to graduate? You ought
to be willing to do as much as Spud and myself."</p>

<p>"All right, then, Bob, if you are going to put
it that way," was the answer, and thereupon Sam
allowed his name to go on the list of prospective
players and at once began training.</p>

<p>After that matters moved along swiftly. The
committee from Brill met with the committee
from Roxley and arrangements were perfected
for the coming game. As the contest had taken
place the year previous at Roxley, it was, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
course, decided that the game this year should
be played at Brill. Then men were set at work
to place the diamond in the best possible shape
for the contest, and the grandstand was repaired,
and a new set of bleachers put up to accommodate
a larger crowd than ever.</p>

<p>"This is a baseball year," announced Bob
Grimes, "so we can expect a big rush of visitors."
The nine had already won three games of
minor importance.</p>

<p>"They tell me Roxley has got the best team
it ever put in the field," announced Stanley one
day, after he had been over to the other institution.
"They've got three dandy pitchers, and
two outfielders who are crackerjacks at batting.
One of their men told me that they expected
to walk all over us."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see about that," returned Bob
Grimes. "We've got a good team of our own,
and I know every one of us will try to play his
head off to win."</p>

<h3>THE OPENING OF THE BALL GAME</h3>


<p>The day for the great baseball game between
Brill and Roxley dawned clear and bright. Sam
had received word that both of his brothers
with their wives would be on, reaching Ashton
early in the morning. He drove down to the
depot in his automobile to meet the newcomers.</p>

<p>When the train rolled into the station Dick
Rover, as tall and handsome as ever, was the
first to alight, quickly followed by his wife,
Dora. Then came Tom and Nellie.</p>

<p>"Hello, Sam, my boy!" exclaimed Dick, as he
strode up and shook hands, quickly followed by
his wife. "How are you these days? But it is
needless to ask, for you look the picture of
health."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm feeling fine," answered Sam, smiling
broadly.</p>

<p>"Ready to play winning baseball, I presume,"
came from Dora, as she gave him a warm smile.</p>

<p>"Surest thing you know, Dora," he answered.
"Oh, we've got to win from Roxley to-day!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but you haven't got me to pitch for
you to-day, Sam," broke in Tom, as he came up
and shook hands. "Who is going to do the
twirling for Brill?"</p>

<p>"They are going to try Dare Phelps first, and
if he can't make it, they will try Jack Dudley,
one of the sophs."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember Dudley when he was
a freshman," answered Tom. "Pretty clever fellow,
too."</p>

<p>"How is it you didn't bring Grace with you,
Sam?" questioned Nellie, as she took his hand.</p>

<p>"I'm to take you two girls up to Hope after
I leave Tom and Dick at Brill," explained the
youngest Rover. "Then we are to get all of you
girls directly after lunch. Grace wanted it that
way."</p>

<p>"My! but this is a touch of old times," remarked
Dick, as he climbed into the automobile.
"Let me take the wheel, Sam."</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you want to," was the quick
reply, and a few minutes later, with the oldest
Rover running the machine, the whole party set
off for Brill.</p>

<p>"How are matters going in New York, Dick?"
questioned Sam, while they rode along.</p>

<p>"We are doing quite well, Sam. Of course,
we are having a little difficulty in certain directions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
but that is to be expected. You must
remember in Wall Street the rivalries are very
keen. I suppose some of our competitors would
like to put us out of business."</p>

<p>"What about that tour Tom mentioned?"</p>

<p>"I think we can make it, Sam. I'll know more
about it a little later. There is no hurry, you
know, because you've got to graduate first," and
Dick smiled knowingly at his brother.</p>

<p>Songbird and some of the other collegians
were waiting to welcome Dick and Tom, and as
soon as they had left the automobile Sam continued
on the way to Hope.</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm so glad to see you!" cried Grace, as
she rushed out and kissed her sister and her
cousin. "Come right in. We are going to have
a special lunch in your honor. Sam, I'm sorry
I can't invite you, but you know what the rules
are."</p>

<p>"Never mind. Tom will be on hand at one-thirty
promptly," answered the youth. "I hope
you'll all be ready, for we can't delay, you
know."</p>

<p>"We'll be ready, don't fear," answered Grace.</p>

<p>When Sam returned to Brill he found a crowd
of the seniors surrounding his brothers, telling
them of the many things that had happened in
and around the college since they had left.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a jolly shame we can't have you in the
box to-day, Tom," said Bob Grimes. "I'm afraid
we'll need you sorely," he added rather anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why don't you put William Philander Tubbs
in?" suggested Tom, with a grin. "Don't you
remember what a famous ball player he was?"
And then there was a general laugh, at the recollection
of a joke that had once been played on
the dudish college student.</p>

<p>The air was filled with talk of the coming
game, and but scant attention was paid to the
lunch provided for the collegians and their
guests. As soon as the meal was over, Tom took
the Rover's automobile and started for Hope to
bring Grace and the others. When he arrived
there he found his wife, Dora and Grace talking
to Ada Waltham and her brother Chester,
to whom he was introduced.</p>

<p>"We are going over to the game," announced
Chester Waltham. "Ada and I are going to take
half a dozen of the young ladies."</p>

<p>"Fine!" returned Tom. "The more the merrier!
Don't forget to tell the girls to whoop
her up for Brill."</p>

<p>"I think the most of them will do that," said
Ada Waltham; "although one or two of them are
Roxley sympathizers."</p>

<p>"Well, Brill can't have everything its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
way," answered Tom. A few minutes later he
was on the return with Grace, Nellie and Dora.</p>

<p>When he arrived he found Sam awaiting
them, and all walked down to the grandstand,
where seats had been provided for the party.
Grace and the others had just been made comfortable
when Chester Waltham arrived with his
sister and a number of others. The young millionaire
came forward with a broad smile and
was quickly introduced, and he lost no time in
seating his sister next to Grace, while he sat directly
behind the pair, with all the other girls
he had brought close by. This arrangement
did not altogether suit Sam, and he hurried off
to the dressing-room to get into his baseball uniform
in rather a doubtful frame of mind.</p>

<p>A little later there was a grand shouting at
the entrance to the field, and into sight came a
large automobile truck containing a drum and
fife corps and carrying a large Roxley banner.
The truck was followed by a dozen or more automobiles
containing the Roxley team and their
fellow-students. The students had tin horns and
wooden rattles.</p>

<p>"Zip! Hurrah! Roxley!" was the cry, and
then followed a great noise from the horns and
rattles.</p>

<p>"Brill! Brill! Brill!" was the counter cry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
then the furious din was taken up by the other
side.</p>

<p>After that the grandstand filled up rapidly
and so did the bleachers, until there was not an
available seat remaining. In the meanwhile, a
parking place for automobiles and carriages at
the far end of the field was also well patronized.</p>

<p>"Some crowd, and no mistake!" was Stanley's
comment, as he looked at the masses of humanity
waving flags and banners and tooting
their horns and using various other devices for
making noise. "This is by far the biggest crowd
we have ever had."</p>

<p>"Roxley has sent word all around that they
are going to bury us this year," returned another
student standing by. "They claim they have a
team that can't be beaten."</p>

<p>Down in the dressing-room Bob was giving
some final instructions to his men.</p>

<p>"I want you to play from the word 'go,'" he
said. "Sometimes a game is lost or won in the
first inning. Don't let them get any kind of a
lead if you can possibly help it."</p>

<p>It had been decided almost at the last minute
that instead of covering left field Sam should
cover third base. There was a big cheer for
the Roxley team when it made its appearance
on the field, and another cheer when the Brill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
nine showed itself. Then came the toss-up, and
it was decided that Brill should go to the bat
first.</p>

<p>The first man to the bat was a tall fellow who
played center field, and as he came forward many
of the Brill sympathizers cheered him lustily.</p>

<p>"Now show 'em what you can do!"</p>

<p>"Knock it over the back fence!"</p>

<p>The ball came in and the batter swung for it
and missed it.</p>

<p>"Strike one!"</p>

<p>"That's the way to do it, Muggs!"</p>

<p>Again the ball came in, and this time there was
a foul tip.</p>

<p>"Foul! Strike two!"</p>

<p>Following this second strike came two balls,
over which the Brill contingent cheered. Then
came a swift inshoot, which the batter missed by
the fraction of an inch.</p>

<p>"Strike three! Batter out!" sang out the umpire.</p>

<p>"That's the way to do it, Muggs!" came the
yell from the Roxley cohorts, and there followed
a din of horns and rattles.</p>

<p>The second man up for Brill managed to get
to first, but the next one went out on a pop fly,
and then the man on first was caught trying to
steal to second.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the way to do it, Roxley! Keep it
up!" And as a goose egg was put up for Brill
on the score board the opponents cheered as wildly
as ever.</p>

<p>But if Roxley had hoped to score in that first
inning, her expectations were doomed to disappointment.
The first man up went out on a pop
fly, the second on a foul, and although the third
managed to reach second base on what should
have really been a one-base hit, the fourth man
up knocked an easy one to first which ended their
hopes.</p>

<p>It was not until the second inning that Sam
came to the bat. There were two men out when
he grasped the ashen stick and took his stand beside
the home plate. He had a strike and two
balls called on him, and then sent a clean hit
between first and second bases.</p>

<p>"Run, Sam, run!" yelled Dick.</p>

<p>"Leg it, old man, leg it!" added Tom, and the
youngest Rover certainly did speed for first, arriving
there just a second before the ball.</p>

<p>"Oh, if only he can get in!" cried Grace, clapping
her hands.</p>

<p>"It's a long way around to home plate," put
in Chester Waltham. "He's got to have help to
do it."</p>

<p>A moment later the next man to the bat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
knocked an easy fly to second and that ended the
chances for Sam's scoring, and another goose
egg went up for Brill on the score board.</p>

<p>In the end of the second inning Roxley was
fortunate enough to open the play with a neat
drive which brought the batter to second. Then
came another one-base hit, and amid a wild yelling
the runner from second slid in over the home
plate.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Hurrah! A run for Roxley!"</p>

<p>"That's the way to do it! Keep it up! Snow
Brill under!"</p>

<p>Bob Grimes walked up to Dare Phelps, who
was occupying the pitcher's box.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, Dare," he pleaded. "Don't let
'em rattle you."</p>

<p>"They are not going to rattle me," responded
Dare Phelps, and pitched the next batter out in
one-two-three order. In the meantime, however,
the man on first managed to steal second. A
moment later he tried to reach third. The
pitcher threw the ball to Sam, who leaped up
into the air and caught it, coming down on
the runner while he was still a foot from the
bag.</p>

<p>"Runner out!" cried the umpire, and Roxley's
player arose rather crestfallen and limped off to
the benches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's the way to do it, Sam. Nab 'em every
time!" cried Tom.</p>

<p>When the inning was ended Roxley had only
the one run to its credit.</p>

<p>Brill came to the bat for the third time with
a sort of do-or-die look on the faces of the players.
It was plucky little Spud who started a batting
streak, getting safely to first and followed
by another player who managed to reach second,
landing Spud on third. Then came two outs.
Before the inning was ended, however, two runs
were placed on the board to the credit of Brill.</p>

<p>"Two to one in favor of Brill!" cried one of
the students.</p>

<p>"Just wait, this inning isn't over yet!" cried
one of the Roxley sympathizers. Then Roxley
went to the bat, and because of a bad fumble
on the part of the Brill second baseman, they
managed to secure another run.</p>

<p>"Two to two!" was the cry, as the figures went
up on the big score board.</p>

<p>"Anybody's game, so far," said Dick Rover,
soberly, "but I do hope Brill wins."</p>

<p>"And so do I," answered his brother Tom.</p>

<h3>HOW THE GAME ENDED</h3>


<p>In the fourth inning Brill did its best to get
in another run. There were two one-base hits
made, but these were followed by a strike-out
and two pop flies, so the hits availed nothing.</p>

<p>"Such playing as that isn't helping us any,"
was Dick's remark in a low tone to Tom.</p>

<p>"Well, those first two men up managed to find
the ball," returned Tom, hopefully.</p>

<p>But if Brill had not fared well in that inning,
Roxley did no better, so far as bringing in runs
were concerned. But the Roxley batters found
Phelps quite easily, pounding out numerous fouls.</p>

<p>"The score is two to two," remarked Chester
Waltham, when the Brill team came up to the
bat in the fifth inning. In this, with one man
out, Sam managed to send a neat drive directly
past the Roxley shortstop. He gained first with
ease, and then, taking a desperate chance, slid
safely to second.</p>

<p>"Good work, Rover! Keep it up!" came from
one of his chums.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"That won't do him any good. They can't
bring it in," called out a Roxley sympathizer,
and he proved to be a true prophet, for the inning
came to an end with no additional runs,
Sam getting no chance to advance beyond the
second bag.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Phelps, keep cool," admonished
Bob, when in the second half of the fifth inning
the Brill pitcher passed the first batter on balls.</p>

<p>"All right, I'll do my best," answered Dare
Phelps. "But I must confess my arm is beginning
to hurt me," he added.</p>

<p>"Do you want to drop out?" questioned the
captain, quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not until they hit me more than they
have," responded the Brill pitcher, grimly.</p>

<p>There followed one out, but after that came
some free hitting which brought in two runs.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Hurrah!" shouted the Roxley students.</p>

<p>"Two to four in favor of Roxley! That's the
way to do it! Snow 'em under!"</p>

<p>"Steady, Phelps, steady," warned the Brill
captain. But it was of no avail, and the only
way Brill could bring that inning to a finish was
by the clever work of two of the fielders in capturing
two flies which looked as if they might be
home runs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>When the board showed the score of 2 to 4
Roxley went wild once more, while the followers
of Brill looked correspondingly glum.</p>

<p>"Maybe you had better give Jack Dudley a
chance," suggested Bob to Dare Phelps, when
the two walked into the benches.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me try it just once more!" pleaded the
pitcher. "Anybody might have let in those two
runs."</p>

<p>"All right, Phelps, I'll give you one more
chance," answered Bob, somewhat sharply. "You
know we don't want this game to go to Roxley
if we can possibly help it."</p>

<p>In the sixth inning Brill scored another goose
egg. Then Roxley came once more to the bat,
and on the first ball pitched by Phelps scored a
home run, amid a yelling and cheering that could
be heard for a great distance.</p>

<p>"Whoop! That's the way to do it! Five to
two in favor of Roxley!"</p>

<p>"Keep it up, boys! Snow 'em under! Snow
'em under!" And then the Roxley crowd began
a song, the refrain of which was: "We're here
to-day to bury them!"</p>

<p>The cheering was still at its height when Bob
motioned to Jack Dudley, who had been warming
up in a corner of the field, to come forward
and take Dare Phelps' place. There was a cheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
from Brill for the new pitcher, while Phelps retired
rather crestfallen.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Dudley, put 'em out in one-two-three
order!" was the cry.</p>

<p>"We've killed off one pitcher; now kill off the
next!" came the cry from the Roxleyites.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, Dudley," warned Bob. "Give
'em your inshoot and that new fadeaway."</p>

<p>"I'll give 'em all that is in me," returned Jack
Dudley, with a determined look on his lean, and
somewhat angular, face.</p>

<p>The first man up got two balls and two strikes.
Then came a foul tip, followed by another strike.</p>

<p>"Strike three! Batter out!" called the umpire.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! That's the way to do it, Dudley!"</p>

<p>The next man managed to get to first, but then
came two more outs, and the sixth inning came
to a close with the score still standing, Brill 2&mdash;Roxley
5.</p>

<p>"That's some lead," remarked Chester Waltham.
"Brill has got to get busy pretty quickly
if it expects to win this game."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll get there, don't you worry," answered
Tom, quickly, and then he shouted: "Go
to it, fellows; go to it! Lambast the life out of
that leather!" and at this cry there was a general
laugh.</p>

<p>The seventh inning proved a blank for both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
teams. Brill, however, managed to reach second,
while Roxley was pitched out in one-two-three
order by Dudley.</p>

<p>"Well, Dudley held them down that time," remarked
Dick Rover. "I hope he manages to
keep the good work up."</p>

<p>"Yes, but a pitcher can't win a ball game
alone," answered Chester Waltham. "You've got
to have some good batters."</p>

<p>"Go to it, Brill! Go to it! This is your lucky
inning!" yelled Tom, enthusiastically. "Get busy,
everybody!"</p>

<p>In the eighth inning the first man up for Brill
went out on a pop fly. But then came a fine
hit that took the next player safely to second.
Then Sam walked to the plate.</p>

<p>"That's the way to do it, Brill!"</p>

<p>"Now, Rover, hit it for all you are worth!"</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Sam felt a trifle
nervous, so anxious was he to make some sort
of a showing. He swung his ashen stick at the
first ball pitched.</p>

<p>"Strike one!" came from the umpire.</p>

<p>"Take your time, Sam!" yelled Tom. "Make
him give it to you where you want it!"</p>

<p>Whether Sam heard the cry or not it would be
hard to say, but he let the next ball go by, and
then repeated this action.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ball two!" called the umpire.</p>

<p>"Oh, say! That was all right!" grumbled the
Roxley catcher. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Too far out," returned the umpire sharply,
and then added: "Play ball!"</p>

<p>The next one was a straight drive, and Sam
swung at it with all the strength and skill he
possessed.</p>

<p>Crack! The ashen stick hit the leather, and the
sphere went sailing far down into center field.</p>

<p>"Go it, Rover, go it!"</p>

<p>"Come on in, Orben!"</p>

<p>Paul Orben, who had been the player to reach
second, was already streaking up to third, and by
the time Sam reached first Paul was legging it
for the home plate.</p>

<p>"Throw that ball up here! Throw that ball
up!" yelled the second baseman to the center
fielder, who was still chasing after the bouncing
leather.</p>

<p>Then amid a cloud of dust Paul slid in over
the home plate while Sam, having reached second,
was legging it rapidly for third. Up came
the ball from the field to second, and then to
third, but before it got there the youngest Rover
was safely clutching the bag.</p>

<p>"Whoop! Hurrah! That's the way to do it!
One run in and another on the way."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Keep it up, Brill! You've struck your winning
streak!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I do hope Sam can bring that
run in!" came from Grace.</p>

<p>"It might have been a home run if he had
only run a little faster," remarked Chester Waltham.</p>

<p>"Faster!" retorted Tom, quickly. "Why, he
legged it like greased lightning! Most players
would have gotten only two bags out of that
hit."</p>

<p>Following this batting came another out, but
then the next man up managed to reach first,
and amid a wild cheering on the part of the Brillites,
and a loud tooting of horns, Sam rushed
over the home plate.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Hurrah! Another run!"</p>

<p>"That makes the score four to five!"</p>

<p>"Keep up the good work, Brill!"</p>

<p>But that was the end of the run getting for
the time being. Then Roxley came to the bat,
and amid the most intense feeling Jack Dudley
managed to pitch out three men in succession
and the score went up on the board: Brill 4&mdash;Roxley
5.</p>

<p>"Now, fellows, this is our last chance," said
Bob, as the team came in for the ninth inning.
"Remember, one run will tie the score and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
runs may win the game. Now every man up
on the job."</p>

<p>The first batter for Brill in the ninth inning
was plainly nervous. He let two good balls go
by and thereby had two strikes called on him.
Then he made a wild pass at the next ball, knocking
a short foul which the first baseman for Roxley
gathered in by a sensational running leap.</p>

<p>"One man gone! One man gone!" chanted the
Roxley followers. "Now, then, get the other
two."</p>

<p>"Take your time, boys, take your time," cried
Bob. "Make them give you just what you want."</p>

<p>This advice was heeded, and as a result the
next man got to first and on another one-base
hit managed to reach third. Then came a one-bag
drive that brought in a run and took the
man on first to second.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Hurrah! That ties the score!"</p>

<p>"Keep it up, Brill! Bring in all the runs you
can!"</p>

<p>Following the bringing in of the tying run,
there came some field play between the pitcher
and the basemen, and as a result the man who
had reached first was called out trying to steal
second. In the mean time the other runner tried
to steal home, but had to stay on third.</p>

<p>"Be careful, boys, be careful," pleaded Bob,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and then a few seconds later came another base
hit which brought in another run.</p>

<p>"Good! Good! That's the way to do it,
Brill!"</p>

<p>"That makes the score six to five in favor of
Brill!"</p>

<p>"Bring in half a dozen more while you are
at it!"</p>

<p>"Hold them down. Don't let them get another
run," pleaded the captain of Roxley's nine to his
men.</p>

<p>"We're going to make a dozen more," announced
Tom Rover, gaily. But this was not to
be, and a few minutes later the inning came to
an end with the score standing: Brill 6&mdash;Roxley
5.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Roxley, one run to tie the score
and two to win the game!" was the cry from
the visitors.</p>

<p>"Lam out a couple of homers!"</p>

<p>"Show 'em where the back fence is!"</p>

<p>In that ninth inning Roxley came to the bat
with a "do-or-die" look.</p>

<p>"Now watch yourself, Dudley," whispered Bob
to the pitcher. "Don't let them rattle you."</p>

<p>"They are not going to rattle me," answered
Dudley. Yet it was plainly to be seen that the
sophomore was nervous, and that the strain of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the situation was beginning to tell upon him.
Nevertheless, amid a wild cheering on the part of
Brill, he struck out the first man up.</p>

<p>"That's the way to do it, Brill!"</p>

<p>"It's all over but the shouting!" shrieked one
Brill sympathizer.</p>

<p>"Not much! Here is where we make half a
dozen runs!" yelled a Roxleyite.</p>

<p>The next batter up was a notoriously hard hitter.
Dudley was afraid to give him something
easy, and as a consequence the pitcher had four
balls called on him and the batter went to first.
Then came a drive to center field which took
the man on first to second, while the batter
reached first with ease.</p>

<p>"That's the way to do it, Roxley! Now you've
got 'em going!"</p>

<p>With only one man out and two men on bases,
Jack Dudley was more nervous than ever. Yet
Bob did not have the heart to take him out of
the box, and, besides, he had no pitcher on hand
who was any better.</p>

<p>"Hold 'em down, Dudley! Hold 'em down!"
pleaded the captain. "Don't feed 'em any easy
ones." And the pitcher nodded grimly, being too
nervous to even answer.</p>

<p>A ball was called and then a strike. Then
Dudley fed the batter a straight one. Crack!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
The ashen stick met the sphere and sent it along
just inside the third base line.</p>

<p>"Run! Everybody run!" was the yell from
the Roxley contingent, and while the batter
dropped his stick and sped toward first, the man
on that bag legged it for second and the man
on second rushed madly toward third.</p>

<p>For one brief instant it looked as if one, and
possibly two, runs would be scored. But then,
Sam, playing a little off third, made a wild leap
into the air and pulled down the ball. Next, like
a flash, he tagged the man sliding in toward the
third bag.</p>

</div>

<p>"Batter out! Runner out!" announced the umpire.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Hurrah! Brill wins the game!"</p>

<p>"Say! that was a dandy catch by Rover,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And how neatly he put that runner out,
too!"</p>

<p>And then as the score, Brill 6&mdash;Roxley 5, was
placed on the big board a wild yelling, tooting of
horns, and sounding of rattles rent the air. Once
more Brill had vanquished its old opponent.</p>

<p>And everybody said that Sam Rover was the
hero of the occasion.</p>

<h3>GOOD-BYE TO BRILL</h3>


<p>The celebration at Brill that evening was one
long to be remembered. Bonfires blazed along
the river front, and the students marched around
them, and around the campus and the college
buildings, singing songs and having a good time
generally.</p>

<p>The others had insisted that the Rovers take
part in these festivities, and so the boys had taken
the girls to Hope, where Dora and Nellie were
to remain until the next day.</p>

<p>"I must say I am mighty glad I came," said
Dick to his brothers, as he surveyed the shouting
and marching students. "This certainly takes me
back to the days when I was here."</p>

<p>"I'm going in for some fun," announced Tom,
and was soon in the midst of the activities. The
students played jokes on William Philander
Tubbs, old Filbury, and on a number of others,
and the fun-loving Rover helped them all he
could. An attempt was also made to get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
captured banners of the freshmen and sophomores
from Sam's room, but this failed.</p>

<p>"The boys are rather noisy to-night," said one
of the professors to Dr. Wallington.</p>

<p>"I agree with you, sir," returned the head of
Brill, "but then they have something to be noisy
about. Their victory was certainly well earned,"
and the doctor smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>Many had come forward to congratulate Sam
on his fine work in putting through a double play
unassisted in the last inning.</p>

<p>"It saved the day for Brill," announced Stanley,
and many agreed with him.</p>

<p>The great game had taken place on Saturday
afternoon, so, as the next day was Sunday, Sam
could do as he pleased. The Rovers had an early
breakfast, and then lost no time in riding over
to the seminary, where they found the others
waiting for them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam, your playing was simply wonderful!"
declared Grace, as she beamed on him.
"How you ever caught that fly in the last inning
is beyond me."</p>

<p>"Yes, and what do you think?" put in Grace's
sister. "Mr. Waltham said he thought it was
quite an ordinary play&mdash;that any good, all-around
player could have done what Sam did!"</p>

<p>"Maybe he was a bit jealous of Sam," was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Dora's comment, and as she spoke she looked
rather keenly at Grace, who, of a sudden, blushed
deeply.</p>

<p>"I suppose Waltham brought his sister and
those girls back here last evening," said Sam.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Nellie, "and they insisted
that we join them in a little treat. Mr. Waltham
drove down to Ashton for some ice cream, fancy
crackers and candy, and we had quite a spread
under the trees. It certainly was very nice of
him to do it."</p>

<p>"I suppose he's got so much money he doesn't
know what to do with it," was Dick's comment.</p>

<p>"He was asking me about that tour that we
propose taking this summer," said Dora. "He
added that he and his sister and maybe others
were going to take a tour in his new car, but
he hadn't decided on where they were going, and
he thought it might be rather jolly if he joined
our touring party."</p>

<p>"Humph! I don't see&mdash;&mdash;" began Sam, and
then broke off suddenly.</p>

<p>"It would be lovely to have Ada along," said
Grace. "She is a splendid girl, and we've become
quite chummy since Nellie and Dora went
away."</p>

<p>"Well, we haven't any time to settle about
that tour just now," announced Dick. "Our train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
leaves in a couple of hours and you girls have
got to pack up before we start for the Ashton
depot."</p>

<p>The mention of Chester Waltham, along with
the fact that he might join them on their proposed
automobile tour, put rather a damper on
Sam's feelings. He acted very soberly, and his
remarks to Grace were not half as cordial as
they usually were. Evidently Sam's "nose was
out of joint," although he was not willing to
admit it, even to himself.</p>

<p>All drove down to the Ashton depot, and there
Sam and Grace said good-bye to the others, who
were going on to the home farm at Valley Brook
and then to New York City. On the return to
the seminary Sam had hoped to have a long talk
and an understanding with Grace, but unfortunately
two girls turned up who wished to get
back to Hope, and there was nothing for the
Rover boy to do but to invite them to ride along,
so that the confidential talk between them had
to be abandoned.</p>

<p>After the great ball game matters quieted
down at Brill. All of the seniors were hard at
work getting ready for the final examinations,
which would start on the week following.</p>

<p>"If you make as good a showing in the examinations
as you made on the ball field, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
sure will prove a winner," declared Bob to Sam
one day.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to do my level best, Bob,"
was the reply. "You see, neither Dick nor Tom
had a chance to graduate, so I've got to make
a showing for the entire family."</p>

<p>During those days nothing further had been
heard regarding Blackie Crowden or the missing
money. Sam and Songbird had met Belright
Fogg once on the streets of Ashton, but the lawyer
had marched past without deigning to speak
to them.</p>

<p>"He's a foxy customer," was the comment of
the would-be poet of Brill. "If he had anything
to do with Blackie Crowden, he'll try his level
best to keep it to himself."</p>

<p>At last the examinations began. They were to
continue for the best part of two weeks, and
during that time Sam cut out all sports and confined
himself to his studies with greater diligence
than ever. He had several important papers to
hand in, and he worked over these early and late,
rewriting and polishing until there seemed to be
absolutely nothing more that could be done.
Songbird also was busy, for in addition to his
studies and themes he had been asked by the
class to write a poem in honor of the coming
occasion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"I only wish I could write something that
would bring in some cash," remarked the would-be
poet one afternoon.</p>

<p>Although he had not apprised Sam of that
fact, Songbird had copied off several of his
best poems and sent them to various publishers,
hoping that they might prove acceptable and
bring in some money which he might turn over
to Mr. Sanderson as an evidence of what he
hoped to do in the future. So far, however, he
had not heard from any of the poems but one,
which had been promptly returned.</p>

<p>At last came the day when the examinations
ended. All the themes written by the students
had been handed in, and Sam found himself free
to do as he pleased. He at once sought Grace
by means of the telephone, hoping to get her
to take an automobile ride with him.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," she answered over the wire,
"but I have still another examination to take and
a theme to finish, so I don't dare to think of going
out."</p>

<p>"How have you made out so far?" questioned
the youth.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Sam. Sometimes I think I
have done very well, and then again I am afraid
that I missed a great many things. How did you
make out?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I think I'll pass, but how high up I don't
know. I am hoping for great things, but I may
be mistaken." And there the conversation had
to come to an abrupt end, for a professor came
in to use the Brill telephone.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Sam slept rather uneasily
on the night before the morning on which
the announcement concerning each student's
standing was to be made.</p>

<p>"I'm scared to death," came from Spud. "I
missed a whole lot of questions."</p>

<p>"So did I," put in Paul. "And I boned hard
too," he added dismally.</p>

<p>Finally came the announcement. Out of a class
of sixty-five seniors, sixty-two had passed.
Sam's name was at the head of the list with a
percentage of ninety-seven; Songbird came
fourth with a percentage of ninety-three; Spud
had ninety-one, and Stanley the same; while
Paul, William Philander Tubbs and a number of
others were listed at from eighty to eighty-eight
per cent.</p>

<p>"Sam, allow me to congratulate you!" cried
Songbird, as he came up to wring his friend's
hand. "You certainly made a splendid showing."</p>

<p>"You made a pretty good showing yourself,"
answered Sam, his face beaming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your folks will be mighty glad to hear of
this," went on the would-be poet of Brill. "Why
don't you telegraph to them?"</p>

<p>"Just what I'm going to do," answered the
Rover boy. "And I'm going to telephone to
Hope, too," he added.</p>

<p>"That's the talk. I wish I could telephone
over to the Sandersons."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Songbird, I'll drive you over
there when I drive to the seminary," replied Sam.</p>

<p>The days to follow were delightful ones for
Sam. True to his promise, he took Songbird
over to the Sanderson homestead and then visited
Grace. The girl had passed third from
the top of her class and was correspondingly
delighted.</p>

<p>"We had such dreadfully hard questions I
thought I should never get through," she confessed
to the youth when they were alone. "And
you came out on top, Sam. Oh, it's wonderful&mdash;simply
wonderful!" and she caught both his
hands.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad&mdash;glad for myself and glad
for you, Grace," he answered, and looked her
full in the eyes. She looked at him in return
and blushed prettily.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Rover, allow me to congratulate
you," came from somebody near by, and Ada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Waltham came tripping up. "Grace told me all
about your wonderful showing."</p>

<p>"Ada made a splendid showing herself," answered
Grace, before Sam could speak.</p>

<p>"I was one point behind Grace," answered
the rich girl, "and that certainly was wonderful
for me. I never was very keen about studying&mdash;in
fact, I didn't want to go to college, only I
had to do it if I wanted to inherit the money that
my uncle left me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam! and to think our days of studying
are over at last!" burst out Grace. "I can
scarcely believe it."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it myself, Grace," he answered.
"It seems to me I've been going to school all
my life. Just think of the years and years I
put in at Putnam Hall Military Academy before
I came to Brill!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and to think of the years I put in at
the Cedarville school before I came to Hope,"
returned Grace. "Now it is all over I feel quite
old," and she laughed merrily.</p>

<p>As was the usual custom, it had been decided
that graduation exercises at Hope should take
place two days before those at Brill, which would
give ample opportunity for those desiring to do
so to attend both functions.</p>

<p>"My folks are all coming to the graduations,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
announced Grace, a day or two after the conversation
just recorded.</p>

<p>"Yes, and my folks will all be on hand," answered
Sam. "Even Uncle Randolph and Aunt
Martha are coming. Dear, old Aunt Martha!"
he said. "She has been a regular mother to us
boys ever since I can remember. I'm awfully
glad she will be present, and I'll be mighty glad
to have Uncle Randolph too, not to say anything
about dear, old dad."</p>

<p>After that there seemed to be so much to do
and so many things to think about that time sped
with amazing swiftness. The Rovers and the
Lanings had engaged rooms at the leading hotel
in Ashton, and arrived on the day previous to
the graduation exercises at Hope.</p>

<p>"Tell you what, education is a great thing!"
remarked Mr. John Laning when speaking of
the matter to Mr. Rover. "I didn't have much
of a chance at it when I was a boy&mdash;I had to go
out and scrap for a living&mdash;but I'm mighty glad
that I had the means to give the girls the learning
they've got."</p>

<p>"You're right&mdash;it is a great thing," answered
Mr. Anderson Rover. "I am only sorry now
that Dick and Tom didn't have the chance to
graduate as well as Sam. But, you know, I was
very sick and somebody had to look after our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
business affairs. And what those boys have done
for me is simply wonderful!"</p>

<p>"The greatest boys that ever lived," announced
Randolph Rover. "They used to bother the life
out of me with their fun and noise, but now
that they have settled down and made men of
themselves I forgive them for all the annoyances."</p>

<p>Sam's father had brought for him as a graduation
present a very fine diamond scarf pin, while
his uncle and aunt presented him with a handsomely
engraved cardcase and Dick and the
others brought him a ring set with a ruby.
Grace's folks and the others had also brought
several gifts of value for the girl, and to these
Sam added a bracelet and the finest bouquet of
flowers he could obtain in Ashton.</p>

<p>The graduation exercises at Hope were exceedingly
pretty. All the girls were dressed in white,
and they formed a beautiful picture as they stood
in a long line to receive their diplomas. The onlookers
clapped vigorously, but no one with more
fervor than did Sam when Grace received her
roll. The exercises were followed by a reception
that evening at which the fair girl graduates
shone as they never had before.</p>

<p>"And now for the big event at Brill!" said
Dick, when on the way back to Ashton that evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
"Sam, aren't you a bit sorry to leave the
old college?"</p>

<p>"I certainly am, Dick. At the same time,
now that you and Tom have buckled down to
business, I feel that I ought to be doing likewise."</p>

<p>"Yes, but all of you young folks are going on
that tour first," announced the boys' father. "I
think you have earned it, and I want you to have
it. I'll supply all the funds necessary, and I'll
see to it that everything goes right at the office
while you are away."</p>

<p>Never had Brill been so crowded as it was at
those graduation exercises. Every seat in the college
hall was occupied, and every doorway and
open window held its group of eager onlookers.
The Rover family had seats almost in the center
of the auditorium, and all of the Lanings were
with them.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's grand! just grand!" murmured Aunt
Martha, as she saw Sam and the rest of the
senior class gathering. "Oh! how proud I am
of that boy!" and the tears coursed freely down
her cheeks.</p>

<p>The valedictory address had been written by
Sam and was delivered by the class orator, Stanley.
This was followed by a class poem written
by Songbird and delivered by a student named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Wells. Sam's valedictory was received with loud
clapping of hands.</p>

<p>"A well written paper&mdash;very well written, indeed,"
was Dr. Wallington's comment, and a
great number of visitors agreed with him. Songbird
had worked hard over his class poem, which
contained many allusions to local matters, and
was received with many smiles and expressions
of good humor.</p>

<p>"Songbird is certainly becoming something of
a poet," was Dick's comment. "If he keeps on,
some day he'll become the simon-pure article."</p>

<p>At last it was over, and Sam, with his sheepskin
rolled up and tied with a ribbon, joined his
folks. His father was the first to congratulate
him, and then came old Aunt Martha, who wept
freely as she embraced him.</p>

<p>"I'm proud of you, Sam, proud of you!" she
said, in a voice trembling with emotion. "What
a pity your own mother couldn't be here to see
you! But the good Lord willed it otherwise,
so we must be content."</p>

<p>"Sam, you've certainly done the family proud
this day," announced his oldest brother. "To
graduate at the top of the class is going some."</p>

<p>"Well, I've got to do something for the Rover
name," said the happy youth, modestly.</p>

<p>There was another reception that night, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
again the bonfires blazed along the bank of the
river. The undergraduates "cut loose" as usual,
but those who were to leave Brill forever were a
trifle sober.</p>

<p>"It's been a fine old college to go to," was
Dick's comment.</p>

<p>"You're right there, Dick," came from Tom.
"A fine place, indeed!"</p>

<p>"The best in the world!" answered Sam. He
drew a deep breath. "No matter where I go in
this old world of ours, I'll never forget my
days at Brill."</p>

<h3>GETTING READY FOR THE TOUR</h3>


<p>"And now for the grand tour!"</p>

<p>"That's the talk, Sam! We ought to have the
best time ever," returned his brother Tom.</p>

<p>"Just to think of such an outing makes me feel
five years younger," came from Dick Rover. "I
like work as well as any one, but a fellow has
got to break away once in a while."</p>

<p>"And to think we are going away out to Colorado
Springs and Pike's Peak!" burst out Dora.</p>

<p>"And all the way in our automobiles!" added
Nellie. "I hope we don't have any breakdowns."</p>

<p>"So it's decided that we are to start Monday
morning, is it?" asked Dick's wife.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dora, provided it is clear," answered
Sam. "Of course there is no use of our starting
our trip in a storm. We'll probably get enough
rain while we are on the way."</p>

<p>"Look here, Sam, don't be a wet blanket!"
cried Tom, catching his younger brother by the
shoulder and whirling him around. "This trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
is going to be perfectly clear from end to end.
I've ordered nothing but sunshine and moonlight,"
and at this remark there was a general
laugh.</p>

<p>The young folks were assembled on the lawn
in front of the old Rover homestead at Valley
Brook. About two weeks had passed since Grace
and Sam had graduated, and during that time
the various arrangements for taking the tour to
the West had been completed by the Rover boys.
In the meantime, Fourth of July had been spent
in Cedarville, at the Laning homestead, where
all had had a glorious time.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry that Songbird and Minnie
can't go with us on this trip," remarked Dick,
"but I know exactly how poor Songbird
feels."</p>

<p>"Yes, he told me he felt he had to go to work,"
returned Sam. "He wants to do his best to earn
that four thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"That's some job for a fellow just out of college
to undertake," was Tom's comment. "What
is he going to do for a living?"</p>

<p>"He has had a place offered to him by his uncle.
He is to start at fifteen dollars a week, and he
says his uncle will advance him as soon as he
learns something about the business."</p>

<p>"They haven't heard any more about that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Blackie Crowden or the missing money?" questioned
Nellie.</p>

<p>"Not a word. And it looks to me now as if
they never would hear anything."</p>

<p>"More than likely that fellow has got out of
the country," was Dick's comment. "Especially
if he has learned that the police are after him."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't tell about that," broke in Tom.
"He may be hiding within a mile or two of where
the crime was committed."</p>

<p>It had been decided that the touring party
should take two automobiles&mdash;that belonging to
the Rovers and a new machine which was the
property of Mrs. Stanhope, Dora's widowed
mother. The party was to consist of Dick and
Tom and their wives, Sam and Grace and Mrs.
Stanhope and Mrs. Laning. Uncle Randolph
and Aunt Martha had also been invited to go
along, but both had declined, stating that they
preferred to remain on the farm.</p>

<p>"I have some important scientific data on farming
to gather," had been Randolph Rover's explanation,
"and, besides that, I must oversee the
building of that new addition to the house;" for
since the marriage of Dick and Tom it had been decided
to build a large wing on the old homestead,
so that the young folks might be accommodated
there whenever they cared to make a visit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Aleck Pop, the faithful old colored servant of
the Rovers, was still at the farm, as was Jack
Ness, the man of all work, and both did all they
could to aid the boys and girls to get ready for
the tour.</p>

<p>"It's most won'erful how you young gen'lemen
has done growed up," was Aleck Pop's comment.
"It don't seem no time at all sence you all was
boys at Putnam Hall," and he grinned broadly,
showing a mouthful of ivories.</p>

<p>"And to think two of 'em are married now
and settled down!" added Jack Ness. "I can't
hardly believe it. First thing you know we'll have
a lot of young Rovers runnin' around this farm."</p>

<p>"Well, if they is any young Robers aroun' yere,
I's gwine to serve 'em jest like I served the
others," answered Aleck Pop, and then went off,
nodding his head vigorously to himself.</p>

<p>The only drawback to the proposed tour, so
far as Sam was concerned, was the fact that
Chester Waltham and his sister Ada were going
to accompany them as far as Colorado Springs.
Then the Walthams proposed to continue to the
Pacific Coast, while the Rovers were to return to
the East.</p>

<p>"Are those two people going in a big touring
car all by themselves?" questioned Sam, when
he heard of this arrangement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are not going to take the touring car,
Sam," answered Grace. "Ada wrote me that her
brother had purchased a new runabout&mdash;a very
speedy and comfortable car&mdash;and they are going
to use that instead."</p>

<p>"Humph! I don't see why they had to stick
themselves in with our crowd," grumbled the
youngest Rover. "Why didn't they take the trip
by themselves?"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe I am to blame for that," answered
Grace. "I told Ada all about our proposed
trip, and said I was sorry that she couldn't go
with us. You must remember she treated me
very nicely while we were at the seminary, especially
after Dora and Nellie left."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't object to Ada," answered Sam.
"Just the same, I think it would be nicer if we
could go off by ourselves. Chester Waltham
and his sister don't seem to fit in with us exactly."</p>

<p>"Well, I think Chester Waltham is a very nice
young man, and certainly he has given me some
splendid rides," answered Grace, and then walked
off to join the others, leaving Sam to do some
thinking which was not altogether agreeable.</p>

<p>The start was to be made from the farm, and
the Walthams had written that they would be on
hand early, stopping for the night at the hotel
in Cornville, some miles away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>On the Friday before the Monday set for the
start, all three of the Rover boys went down to
New York City, to the offices of the newly
formed Rover Company in Wall Street. They
found their father in charge, and also several assistants,
and everything seemed to be in good running
order. Dick and Tom went over a number of
business matters with their parent, and Mr. Rover
declared that he could get along very well without
the boys for at least a month or six weeks.</p>

<p>After the visit to the offices Dick and Tom
took Sam up to their apartments on Riverside
Drive, where they packed a number of things
wanted by themselves and Dora and Nellie.</p>

<p>"Certainly a beautiful location," remarked
Sam, as he walked to one of the front windows,
to gaze out on the Hudson River.</p>

<p>"It certainly is a fine place, Sam," answered
Tom, "and Nellie and I enjoy it just as much
as Dick and Dora do." Tom looked at his
younger brother questioningly. "I suppose now
that you have graduated, Sam, you and Grace
will be joining us here some day?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that, Tom." Sam's face
flushed painfully. "You see I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" and then
he broke off, unable to proceed.</p>

<p>"You don't mean there is anything wrong between
you and Grace, do you?" demanded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
brother, coming closer. Dick had gone to another
room and so was out of hearing.</p>

<p>"I can't say that anything is wrong exactly,
Tom," returned Sam, hesitatingly. "You see,
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it that Chester Waltham?" demanded the
other, quickly.</p>

<p>Sam nodded. "Of course I can't blame him,
and I can't blame Grace, for the matter of that.
It isn't every girl who gets the chance to marry
a young millionaire."</p>

<p>"What! Has he proposed to her?" cried Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I don't think that, Tom. But he has
been very friendly."</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't stand for it, Sam. I think
Grace ought to marry you, and I would tell her
so and have it settled."</p>

<p>"That's all well enough to say, Tom. But just
the same I haven't any right to stand in her light.
I haven't got any such money to offer her as this
millionaire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rot! You've got enough money to make any
girl comfortable, and that is all that is necessary.
You go on in and win!" and Tom clapped his
younger brother on the shoulder encouragingly.
Then Dick entered, along with a maid left to
take care of the apartments, and the talk came
to an end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>While the boys were doing this, the girls had
gone to Cedarville, and there assisted Mrs. Stanhope
and Mrs. Laning in getting ready for the
tour. Dora's mother had a hired chauffeur to
run her car, and this man was to bring the party
to Valley Brook in the Stanhope machine.</p>

<p>"I am very glad you are going, Mother," said
Dora to her parent. "I am sure this trip will
do you a world of good." For Mrs. Stanhope
was not in the best of health and sometimes grew
quite nervous when left too long to herself.</p>

<p>"It will be a wonderful trip, no doubt," answered
the mother, "and I am sure I shall enjoy
it greatly, especially with all you young folks
along to brighten matters up."</p>

<p>"It will certainly be a wonderful tour for me,"
declared Mrs. Laning, who had always been more
or less of a home body. "Gracious! Why, I
can remember when I used to think a trip of ten
or twenty miles on the steam cars was wonderful.
Now just to think of our going hundreds
and hundreds of miles in an automobile!"</p>

<p>"The most wonderful part of it to me is that
we can afford to have you take such a trip as
that, Mother," chuckled John Laning. "Sakes
alive! when I was a young man the height of
my ambition was to own about fifty acres free
and clear, along with a couple of horses and half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
a dozen cows. And now look at us&mdash;here we
own over three hundred acres, got over fifty head
of cattle, over two thousand chickens, and the
finest orchards in this part of the state. I tell
you we've got a lot to be thankful for," he added
with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>"But I'll miss you, John, while I'm away,"
said his faithful wife.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about me, Mother. I'd just
as lief stay here and see all them big crops
a-comin' in," announced the farmer. "That's fun
enough for me. You go ahead with the young
people and enjoy yourself. You've been in harness
long enough and you deserve it."</p>

<p>Mr. Laning had had his ears wide open during
the visit of his daughters and Dora, and before
his wife and the others left for Valley Brook he
called Mrs. Laning aside.</p>

<p>"What's this I hear about Grace going out
with a young millionaire named Waltham?" he
asked, curiously.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you much more than what you've
already heard, John," she answered.</p>

<p>"I thought Grace had her eyes set on Sam
Rover," went on the husband, looking sharply at
his wife.</p>

<p>"That is what I thought myself. But it seems
this young millionaire has been calling on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
sister at Hope, and he's been taking his sister
and Grace out in his automobile and acting very
nicely about it. Grace seems to be quite taken
with him."</p>

<p>"Huh! A young millionaire, eh? Maybe he's
only amusing himself with her. You had better
caution her about him."</p>

<p>"No, John, I don't think that would do any
good. In fact, it might do a great deal of harm,"
declared the wife. "Grace is old enough to know
what she is doing."</p>

<p>"Yes, but if she has made some promises to
Sam Rover&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not sure that she has made any promises.
Sam has been very attentive to her,&mdash;but
just because Tom married Nellie is no reason
why Grace should marry Sam."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that. But, somehow, I thought
they had it all settled between 'em, and I certainly
like Sam. He's a nice, clean-cut boy."</p>

<p>"Yes. I like Sam, too." Mrs. Laning heaved a
deep sigh. "But, just the same, we had better not
interfere. You know how it was when we got
married," and she looked fondly at her husband.</p>

<p>"You bet I do!" he returned, and then put his
arm over her shoulder and kissed her gently.
"Well, let us hope it all comes out for the best,"
he added, and walked off to go to work.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>A MOMENT OF PERIL</h3>


<p>"This is the life!"</p>

<p>"That's right, Tom. This kind of touring suits
me to death," returned Sam Rover.</p>

<p>"Tom, how many miles an hour are you making?"
broke in his wife. "Remember what you
promised me&mdash;that you would keep within the
limit of the law."</p>

<p>"And that is just what I am doing, Nellie,"
he answered. "But it's mighty hard to do it,
believe me, when you are at the wheel of such a
fine auto as this. Why, I could send her ahead
twice as fast if I wanted to!"</p>

<p>"Don't you dare!" burst out Grace, who sat in
the tonneau beside her sister. "If you do I'll
make you let Sam drive."</p>

<p>"He's got to let me drive anyway after dinner,"
said the youngest Rover boy. "That's the
arrangement."</p>

<p>It was the second day of the tour, and Valley
Brook Farm, and in fact the whole central portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
of New York State, had been left far behind.
The weather had turned out perfect, and
so far they had encountered very little in the
way of bad roads. Once they had had to make
a detour of two miles on account of a new bridge
being built, but otherwise they had forged
straight ahead.</p>

<p>Tom and his wife, with Grace and Sam, occupied
the first automobile, the remaining space
in the roomy tonneau being taken up by various
suitcases and other baggage. Behind this car
came the one driven by Dick Rover. Beside him
was his wife, with Mrs. Stanhope and Mrs. Laning
behind them. Some distance to the rear was
the third machine, a brand-new runabout, containing
Chester Waltham and his sister Ada.
Waltham had at first wished to take the lead,
but had then dropped behind, stating he did not
wish to get the others to follow him on any
wrong road.</p>

<p>"You go ahead," he had said to the Rovers.
"Then if you go wrong you will have only yourselves
to blame."</p>

<p>"Well, we don't know any more about these
roads than you do, Waltham," Dick had replied.
"We are simply going by the guide book and the
signs."</p>

<p>"I hate to use up my brains studying an automobile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
guide," Chester Waltham had returned
with a yawn. "When I am on an outing I like to
take it just as easy as I possibly can."</p>

<p>"It's a wonder you didn't bring a paid chauffeur
along," had been Sam's comment.</p>

<p>"I thought something of doing that, but my
sister objected. She said if she was to go along
I must run the car. You see, she wants me to
risk my neck as well as her own," and the young
millionaire had smiled grimly.</p>

<p>They had been running for several miles over
a road that was comparatively straight. On either
side were tidy farms, with occasional farmhouses
and barns. Now, however, the road became
winding, and they soon passed into a patch
of timber.</p>

<p>"Four miles to the next town," announced
Sam, as they rolled past a signboard. He looked
at his watch. "Quarter after eleven. Do you
think we had better stop there for dinner, Tom?"</p>

<p>"No, we are going on to Fernwood, six miles
farther," was the reply. "They say the hotel
there is much better. And, believe me, when you
get away from the big cities the best hotel you
can find in a town is none too good."</p>

<p>It had been rather warm on the open road,
and all those in the automobiles welcomed the
shade of the woods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a pity we didn't bring our lunch along,"
said Dora to Dick, as they moved along at a
slower rate of speed. "We could have had a
good time picnicking along here."</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll have to dine out in the woods
sometimes on this trip," put in Mrs. Laning. "I
like that sort of thing much better than taking
all our meals in hotels or restaurants."</p>

<p>The first automobile had reached a spring by
the roadside, and here Tom came to a halt, presently
followed by the others. Collapsible cups
were handy, and all were ready for a drink
of the pure, cool water which the spring afforded.</p>

<p>"Fine! isn't it?" exclaimed Dick, after the
ladies had been served and he had had a cupful
himself.</p>

<p>"You're right," answered Tom. "A good deal
better than that bottled water we have down in
the New York offices."</p>

<p>"But it can't beat the water on the farm," said
Sam. "I must say no matter where I go the
water doesn't taste quite as good as that at Valley
Brook."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's only sentiment, Sam!" cried Grace.
"Now, I think the water at Cedarville is just
lovely."</p>

<p>"I think you are taking a little chance in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
drinking from a spring like this," was Chester
Waltham's comment. "It may be pure, and then
again it may be full of all sorts of germs."</p>

<p>"Sure! it may be full of tadpoles and bullfrogs,
too," added Tom, gaily. "But you've got
to take some chances in this life, as the fly said
when he flew down into the molasses jug and
got stuck there," and at this little joke there was
a general smile.</p>

<p>Beyond the spring the road went uphill for a
long distance, and then took a turn to the southward,
past more farms and over a bridge spanning
a tiny stream. Then they came to a small
town, looking dry, dusty and almost deserted in
the midday, summer sun.</p>

<p>"I am glad we didn't arrange to stop here,"
was Nellie's comment, as she glanced around.</p>

<p>The sleepy little town was soon left behind,
and once again they found themselves passing
over a series of hills, dotted here and there with
farms and patches of woodland. Then they came
to a place which was very uneven and filled with
rocks.</p>

<p>"Got to be careful here unless we want to get
a puncture," announced Tom, and at once reduced
speed.</p>

<p>They were running on another winding road
which seemed to bear off to the northward. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
there was something of a cliff, with great, rocky
boulders standing out in bold relief.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as Tom reached a bend, he saw a
man coming towards them. He was an Italian,
and carried a small red flag in one hand.</p>

<p>"Back! You-a git-a back!" cried the man,
waving his red flag at them. "Blas'! Blas'!
You git-a back!"</p>

<p>The grade was downward and the man had
appeared so suddenly that before Tom could
bring the first automobile to a standstill he had
gotten at least a hundred feet beyond the Italian,
while the second car, run by Dick, was by the
man's side.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble here?" demanded Dick.</p>

<p>"You git-a back! You git-a back!" exclaimed
the Italian, frantically. "Blas' go off! You git-a
back!"</p>

<p>"Hi, Tom, come back here!" yelled Dick.
"This fellow says there is a blast going off."</p>

<p>Tom was already trying to heed the warning.
He had stopped so suddenly, however, that he
had stalled his engine and now he had to take
time in which to use the electric starter. In
the meanwhile, the Italian workman ran still
farther back, to warn Chester Waltham and anybody
else who might be coming along the
road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Tom! can you turn around?" questioned
his wife anxiously.</p>

<p>"Maybe you had better run the car backward,"
suggested Sam. He had noted the narrowness
of the roadway and knew it would be no easy
matter to turn around in such limited space.
Besides that, there was a deep gully on one
side, so that they would run the risk of overturning.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll back if Dick will only give me
room," muttered Tom, as he pressed the lever
of the self-starter. Then after the power was
once more generated he threw in the reverse gear
and allowed the car to back up.</p>

<p>"That's the way to do it, Tom," yelled Dick.
"Come on, I'll get out of the way," and he, too,
began to back until he was close on to the Waltham
runabout.</p>

<p>"Look out! Don't bump into me!" yelled
Chester Waltham, who for the moment seemed
to be completely bewildered by what was taking
place. "What's the matter anyway?" he demanded
of the Italian.</p>

<p>"Oh, Chester, there must be some danger!"
shrieked his sister. "Say! they are both backing
up. Maybe you had better back up too."</p>

<p>"All right, if that's what they want," answered
the young millionaire, and then in his hurry tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to reverse so quickly that he, too, stalled his
engine.</p>

<p>"Back up! Back up!" called out Dick. "We've
got to get out of here! There is some sort of
blasting going on ahead!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick, be careful!" cried Mrs. Stanhope,
and sprang up in the tonneau of the car in alarm,
quickly followed by Mrs. Laning.</p>

<p>"You will run into Mr. Waltham, sure!"
wailed the latter.</p>

<p>"Don't smash into me! Don't smash into me!"
yelled the young millionaire in sudden terror.
"If you bump into me you'll send me into the
ditch!"</p>

<p>By this time Dick's car was less than three
feet away from the runabout, while Tom's machine
was still some distance farther up the
road.</p>

<p>Boom! There was a distant explosion, not
very loud; and following this came a clatter as
of stones falling on the rocks. None of the
stones, however, fell anywhere near the three
machines.</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Grace.</p>

<p>"Is that all there is to it?" queried Nellie,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned Tom. He had now
brought his automobile once more to a standstill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>All in the three machines waited for a moment.
Then they gazed enquiringly at the Italian who
stood behind them.</p>

<p>"Say, is that all the blasting there is?" demanded
Chester Waltham.</p>

<p>"Dat's heem," responded the foreigner. "He
go off all right, boss. You go," and he waved
the stick of his flag for them to proceed.</p>

<p>"Some scare&mdash;and all for nothing," muttered
Tom. "The way he carried on you would think
they were going to shake down half of yonder
cliff."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, they don't dare to take chances,"
returned Nellie. "Why, if we had gone on we
might have been showered with those stones we
heard falling."</p>

<p>"You fellows want to be careful how you
back up," grumbled Chester Waltham. "You
came pretty close to smashing into me."</p>

<p>"Well, you should have backed up yourself
when you heard us yell," retorted Dick, sharply.
"We didn't know how bad that blast was going
to be."</p>

<p>Tom had already started forward, and in a
moment more Dick and Chester Waltham followed.
But hardly had they done this when the
Italian on the road suddenly let out another yell.</p>

<p>"Boss! Boss! You-a stop!" he cried. "You-a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
stop queek! De two-a blas'! You-a stop!" and
he danced up and down in added alarm.</p>

<p>Those who had gone on paid no attention to
him, and an instant later passed around a corner
of the cliff. As they did this they saw a man
on the open hillside waving his arm and shouting
something they could not understand.</p>

<p>"Tom, something is wrong&mdash;&mdash;" began Sam,
when, of a sudden, his words were swallowed up
in a fierce roar and rumble that seemed to shake
the very ground beneath them. They saw a flash
of fire in an opening of the cliff, and the next
instant a burst of flames and smoke was followed
by a rain of rocks all around them!</p>

<h3>NEWS OF BLACKIE CROWDEN</h3>


<p>It was a moment of extreme peril, and what
made it seem worse was the fact that the Rovers
and the others could do nothing to save themselves.
Rocks, small stones and dirt flew all
around them, striking with loud noises the hoods
and other metal parts of the automobiles, and
even landing in the tonneaus of the larger cars.</p>

<p>"Hold up the robes! Protect yourselves with
the robes!" yelled Dick, but before the ladies
could heed his words the rain of rocks, small
stones and dirt had come to an end.</p>

<p>"Great Cæsar! that's a fine happening!"
groaned Tom, who had been hit on the shoulder
by a fair-sized stone. He looked quickly at those
in the car with him. "Any of you hurt?"</p>

<p>"I got hit in the head with something," returned
Sam. "But it didn't hurt very much.
How about you?" and he looked at Grace and at
Tom's wife.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't think I am hurt any," faltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
Grace, as she looked at some stones and dirt on
the robe over her lap.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," answered Tom's wife. "But,
oh dear! something&mdash;I think it must have been a
big stone&mdash;flew directly past my face!"</p>

<p>"I hope the others got off as well as we did,"
remarked Tom. "Let us go and see," and, suiting
the action to the word, he left the machine,
followed by his brother.</p>

<p>The second car had a dent in the hood made
by a stone as big as Tom's fist. All those in the
automobile had been hit by some smaller stones
and also covered with loose dirt, but no one had
been seriously injured, although Mrs. Laning declared
that some of the dirt had entered her left
ear and also her eye.</p>

<p>"Let me look at that eye," cried Mrs. Stanhope,
as soon as she had recovered from the
shock of the second blast. And then she went
to work on the optic, and presently Mrs. Laning
declared that the eye was as well as ever.</p>

<p>As Chester Waltham and his sister had been
farther back on the road, around the turn of
the cliff, they had not felt the effects of the second
explosion excepting a slight shower of dirt
which had covered the front of the runabout.
But the young millionaire and his sister were
greatly excited, and the former got out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
machine to run up to the Italian with the red
flag and shake his fist in the man's face.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you rascal!" he spluttered. "What do
you mean by sending us into such peril as this?
You ought to be put into prison!"</p>

<p>"I-a, I-a forget heem," faltered the foreigner
helplessly. "I tink only one blas'. I forget
two blas'," and he looked very downhearted.</p>

<p>But this time the man who had been up on
the hillside came running to the scene of the
mishap, followed by several of the workmen.</p>

<p>"Anybody hurt?" sang out the man, who was
an American in charge of the blasting gang.</p>

<p>"Nothing very serious," answered Dick. "But
it might have been," he added sharply. "You
fellows ought to be more careful."</p>

<p>"I told Tony to keep everybody back for two
blasts," answered the man. "Why didn't you
stay back until you heard the second blast?"</p>

<p>"He told us to go on," answered Tom.</p>

<p>"I make mistake," cried the Italian. "You
forgive, boss," and he looked pleadingly at Dick
and the others.</p>

<p>"Well, you don't want to make any more mistakes
like that," returned Dick. "If we had gotten
a little closer somebody might have been
killed."</p>

<p>"That's the second time you have failed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
obey orders, Tony," said the gang master, sternly.
"You go on up to the shanty and get your
time and clear out. I won't have such a careless
man as you around."</p>

<p>At these words the Italian looked much crestfallen.
He began to jabber away in a mixture
of English and his own tongue, both to his boss
and to our friends. But the boss would not listen
to him, and ordered him away, and then he departed,
looking decidedly sullen.</p>

<p>"I can't do anything with some of these fellows,"
explained the man in charge of the blasting.
"I tell them just what to do, and sometimes
they mind me and sometimes they don't.
I'm very sorry this thing happened, but I'm
thankful at the same time that you got through
as well as you did," and he smiled a little.</p>

<p>"You're not half as thankful as we are," put
in Sam, dryly.</p>

<p>"I hope there is no damage done to your cars,
but if there is I'm willing to pay for it," went
on the man.</p>

<p>"A few dents, but I guess that is all," answered
Dick, after a look at both the car he was
driving and the one run by his brother. "We'll
let those go, for we are on a tour and have no
time to waste here."</p>

<p>"All right, sir, just as you say. But here is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
my card; I don't want to sneak out of anything
for which I'm responsible," continued the man.
"If you find anything wrong later on you let me
know and I'll fix it up with you."</p>

<p>"We ought to sue this fellow for damages!"
cried Chester Waltham, wrathfully. "It's an
outrage to treat us like this."</p>

<p>"Were you hurt in any way?" asked the man,
quietly.</p>

<p>"We got a lot of dirt and stones on the runabout,"
growled Waltham.</p>

<p>"Oh, Chester! don't quarrel over the matter,"
entreated his sister, in a low tone. "The man
didn't want to do it."</p>

<p>"Oh, these follows are too fresh," grumbled
the young millionaire. "The authorities ought
to take them in hand," and then he reëntered his
runabout, looking in anything but a happy mood.</p>

<p>"Do you think we can go ahead on this road
now?" asked Dick, after a few more words had
passed between the Rovers and the man who had
the blasting in charge.</p>

<p>"I think so," was the reply. "Just wait a few
minutes and I'll have my gang of men clear a
way for you." He was evidently a fair and
square individual who wanted to do the right
thing in every particular, and the Rovers could
not help but like him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was all that Italian's fault," remarked Sam
to Tom, while they were waiting for the road to
be cleared of the largest of the rocks. "If he
had kept us back as he was ordered to do there
would have been no trouble."</p>

<p>"He looked mighty mad when he went off,"
was Tom's answer. "If that fellow in charge
here doesn't look out, that chap may put up
some job on him."</p>

<p>Inside of ten minutes the man in charge of
the blasting told them they could go ahead, and
so on they went as before, with Tom again in
the lead. As they passed by they saw numerous
places along the face of the cliff where other
blasting had taken place. The man had explained
that the work was being done by the contractors
in order to widen the road in that
vicinity.</p>

<p>About a mile and a half beyond the cliff, nestling
in the midst of a number of pretty farms,
they came to the town of Fernwood, the place
at which they were to stop for their midday meal.
They had the name of the leading hotel on their
list, and found the hostelry a fairly large and
comfortable one.</p>

<p>"I think we'll want a good washing up after
that experience," remarked Dick, when the automobiles
had been placed in the hotel garage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
"My! but that was a narrow escape!" and he
shuddered at the recollection.</p>

<p>"You fellows were mighty easy with that
man," observed Chester Waltham. "He ought
to have been made to suffer for his carelessness."</p>

<p>"Well, if you want to sue him, Waltham,
you go ahead and do it," said Dick somewhat
sharply. He was beginning to like the young
millionaire less and less the more he came in
contact with him.</p>

<p>A table had been reserved for the entire party,
and soon the well-cooked meal put even Chester
Waltham in better humor. Now that the danger
from the blast was a thing of the past, they
could afford to smile over the somewhat thrilling
experience.</p>

<p>"Maybe after this it would be a good idea to
ride with the tops up," said Tom. "Only we'd
have to make them stone proof as well as rainproof,"
and at this remark there was a general
smile.</p>

<p>"Remember, Tom, I'm to be at the wheel this
afternoon," announced Sam, who thus far had
not had much chance to do any steering on the
trip.</p>

<p>"All right, little boy, you for the pilot act!"
returned his fun-loving brother, gaily. "But remember
what the girls told you&mdash;no speeding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
The law in this state is four and one-eighth miles
an hour, except on turning corners, where it
is two and one-sixteenth miles," and at this little
joke there was a titter from the girls.</p>

<p>As it was so warm during the middle of the
day, it had been decided that they should not
proceed on their tour until about three o'clock.
This gave the ladies a chance to rest themselves,
something which was particularly satisfying to
Mrs. Stanhope and Mrs. Laning.</p>

<p>"I think I'll take a look around the town,"
said Tom, after the ladies had gone to one of
the upper rooms. "Will you go along?" and
he looked enquiringly at his brothers and Chester
Waltham.</p>

<p>"I am going to write a letter to dad," answered
Dick.</p>

<p>"I think I'll write a letter myself and enjoy
a smoke," came from the young millionaire.</p>

<p>"I'm with you, Tom," returned his younger
brother. "Let's go out and see if we can't capture
a nice box of chocolates for the girls."</p>

<p>Tom and Sam were soon on the way. The
main street of Fernwood contained less than four
blocks of stores, and there was a cross street
with half a dozen other establishments. But the
place was a railroad center and, consequently,
was of quite some importance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Having walked up and down the main street,
and procured a box of chocolates and a few
other things, the two Rovers wandered off in
the direction of the railroad station. A train had
just come in, and they watched the passengers
alight and then others get aboard. They were
particularly interested in the discomfiture of a
fat traveling salesman who came puffing up on
the platform, a suitcase in each hand, just in
time to see the train depart. The fat man was
very angry, but this availed him nothing.</p>

<p>"It's a shame! a shame!" howled the traveling
salesman, as he threw his suitcases down in disgust.
"I know that train left at least two minutes
ahead of time," he stormed to the station
master.</p>

<p>"You're wrong there, mister," was the ready
answer. "She was a minute late."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Nonsense!" stormed the disappointed
individual. "I tell you she left ahead of
time. I ought to sue the railroad company for
this," and he shook his head savagely.</p>

<p>"Gosh! we are up against people who want
to sue everybody," was Sam's remark. "That
fellow ought to join Chester Waltham, and then
they could hire one lawyer to do the whole business."</p>

<p>"I might have been here five minutes ago if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
I hadn't been a fool," stormed the fat salesman,
as he looked for comfort at the two Rovers.
"That comes from trying to be accommodating.
I was headed for this place when down there
at the Ludding House I met a fellow who wanted
to know how to get to Stockbridge. He stuttered
so that it took me about five minutes to
find out what he wanted."</p>

<p>"Stuttered, did he?" questioned Tom, curiously.</p>

<p>"He sure did! He had an awful stutter with
a funny little whistle in between. I wish I hadn't
waited to listen to him. I might have had that
train, confound it!" went on the fat salesman,
pulling down his face.</p>

<p>"Did you say that fellow stuttered and
whistled?" broke in Sam eagerly.</p>

<p>"He certainly did."</p>

<p>"Will you tell me what kind of a looking man
he was?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" answered the salesman, and then started
to give as good a description of the individual
as his recollection would permit.</p>

<p>"It must have been Blackie Crowden!" cried
the youngest Rover, before the man had finished.</p>

<p>"I don't know what his name was," said the
salesman.</p>

<p>"We want to catch that man the worst way,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
went on Sam. "Have you any idea where we
can find him?"</p>

<p>"He asked me the way to Stockbridge, so I
suppose he was going there," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Where is Stockbridge?"</p>

<p>"It's down on the road past the Ludding
House. It's about five miles from here."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose the man was going to walk
it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. You must remember
I was in a hurry to catch the train. Hang
the luck! I wish I hadn't stopped to talk to
that man," went on the fat salesman.</p>

<p>"And I'm very glad that you did stop to talk
to him," returned Sam. He looked at his brother.
"Come on, Tom, let us see if we can find Blackie
Crowden."</p>

<h3>ON THE TRAIL</h3>


<p>The Ludding House was on the side street
of the town, about three blocks from the hotel
at which our friends were stopping. When the
two Rovers arrived there they found the dining-room
had just closed and only two men and
an elderly woman were in sight.</p>

<p>"We are looking for a man who was around
here&mdash;I think his name was Blackie Crowden,"
said Sam. "He is a man who stutters very
badly."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember that fellow," returned
one of the men who worked around the hotel,
"He was here for lunch."</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where he is now?"</p>

<p>"No, I cannot."</p>

<p>"That man who stuttered so terribly said
something about going to Stockbridge," put in
the woman. "Perhaps he was going there."</p>

<p>"On foot?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so. Most likely he took the
stage. That left about ten minutes ago."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Was the man alone?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I think he was, although I am not sure. He
came in during the lunch hour and after that I
saw him talking to a salesman who had been
staying here&mdash;a man who just went off on the
train."</p>

<p>"You mean a man who went off to catch the
train," grinned Tom. "He didn't get it, and he's
as mad as a hornet on that account."</p>

<p>The two Rovers asked several more questions
and found out that the stage which left Fernwood
twice a day passed through Stockbridge
on its way to Riverview, six miles farther on.</p>

<p>"They used to use horses," explained the hotel
man, "but last year Jerry Lagger got himself an
auto, so he makes the run pretty quick these
days."</p>

<p>"Come on, Sam, let's get one of our autos and
follow that stage," cried Tom, and set off on a
run for the other hotel, quickly followed by his
brother. They burst in on Dick just as the latter
was posting the letter which he had written
to their father.</p>

<p>"Say! that would be great if it was Blackie
Crowden and we could capture him," cried Dick,
on hearing what they had to say. "You get the
auto ready while I tell the others where we are
going."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a pity Stockbridge and Riverview are
not on our regular tour," was Sam's comment.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's just as well," answered Tom. "We
may have lots of trouble with this fellow Crowden,
and it will be just as well if the girls and
the ladies are not in it."</p>

<p>One of the touring cars was quickly run to
the front of the hotel, and a moment later Dick,
who had rushed upstairs to explain matters to
the others, came out and joined his brothers.
Tom was at the wheel, and he lost no time in
speeding up the car, and on they went along
the dusty road in the direction of Stockbridge.</p>

<p>"I do hope they catch that fellow and get
back Mr. Sanderson's money," was Grace's comment,
as she watched the departure of the touring
car out of one of the upper windows of
the hotel.</p>

<p>"What's it all about?" asked Ada Waltham,
who had not been present when Dick had burst
in on the others. She was quickly told and then
asked: "Why didn't they take my brother along
with them?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I am sure, Ada," answered
Grace. "Perhaps he wasn't around."</p>

<p>"He was down in the writing-room with
Dick."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I am sure I don't know why he isn't
with them," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I don't think they are treating Chester just
right," retorted the rich girl, rather abruptly,
and then left the room with her nose tilted high
in the air.</p>

<p>"What a way to act!" murmured Nellie.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that sooner or later we will have
some sort of rupture with the Walthams," was
Dora's comment. She gave a little sigh. "Too
bad! I should hate to have anything happen to
spoil this tour."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think the boys treat Chester
Waltham just right," returned Grace, somewhat
coldly. "They treat him as if he were a stranger&mdash;an
outsider," and then she, too, left the room,
leaving her sister and Dora to gaze at each other
questioningly.</p>

<p>Along the dusty road sped the touring car,
Tom running as rapidly as safety would permit.
Soon Fernwood was left far behind and they
began to ascend a slight hill.</p>

<p>Presently they came to a crossroad, and here
they had to stop to study a much-faded signboard,
so as to decide which was the proper road
to take. Even then, as they continued their way,
they were all a little doubtful.</p>

<p>"That signboard was so twisted it didn't point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
right down this road," was Sam's comment. "It
would be just like some boys to twist it out of
shape just for the fun of sending folks on the
wrong road."</p>

<p>"Well, I played a joke like that myself, once,"
confessed Tom.</p>

<p>"Then if we are on the wrong road on account
of some boys' tricks, Tom, you'll simply be getting
paid back for what you did," returned his
older brother.</p>

<p>Half a mile more was covered, and then the
road grew rapidly worse. Tom had slowed
down, and was just on the point of stopping
when a low hissing sound reached the ears of all.</p>

<p>"Good-night!" was Tom's comment.</p>

<p>"What is it, Tom, a puncture?" queried Sam.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it's only a gas well trying to find its
way to the surface of the ground," was the dry
comment. "Everybody out and to work!"</p>

<p>They leaped to the ground and soon saw that
Sam's conjecture was correct. A sharp stone
had cut into one of the front shoes, making a
hole about as large in diameter as a slate pencil.</p>

<p>"Might know a thing like this would happen
just when we were in a hurry," grumbled Dick.</p>

<p>"Never mind, now is our time to make a record,"
came cheerfully from Sam. He glanced
at his watch. "Four minutes after two. Come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
on, let us see how quickly we can get that new
tire on."</p>

<p>All threw off their coats and caps and set to
work in the shade of some trees. While one
jacked up the car, another worked to get off the
damaged shoe and inner tube. In the meanwhile,
the third got ready another shoe with an
inner tube, and thus working hand in hand the
three got the new tire in place and pumped up
in less than ten minutes.</p>

<p>While Dick and Sam were putting away the
tools, Tom walked a bit ahead on the road. He
looked around a turn, and then came back much
crestfallen.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm paid back for monkeying with
those road-signs years ago," he announced. "The
fellows who fixed that sign some distance behind
us have got one on me. This is nothing
but a woods road, and ends in the timber right
around the bend."</p>

<p>"Which means that we have got to turn back
and take the other road," put in Sam, quickly.</p>

<p>"That's it! Some fun turning around here,"
was Dick's comment. "It's about as narrow as it
was on that road where they were doing the
blasting."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess I can make it," answered Tom;
and then all got in the car once again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>By going ahead and backing half a dozen
times, Tom at last managed to get the touring
car headed the other way. Then he put on
speed once more and they raced off to where
they had made the false turn.</p>

<p>But all this had taken time and as a consequence,
although they ran along the other highway
at a speed of nearly forty miles an hour,
they saw nothing of the auto-stage which had
gone on ahead.</p>

<p>"I guess this is Stockbridge," was Dick's
comment, a little later, as they came in sight of a
straggling village. Several buggies and farm
wagons were in sight and likewise a couple of
cheap automobiles, but nothing that looked like
a stage.</p>

<p>"Has the auto-stage from Fernwood got in
yet?" questioned Sam of a storekeeper who sat
in a tilted chair under the wooden awning of his
establishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, it got in some time ago," was the
drawled-out reply of the storekeeper.</p>

<p>"Then has it gone on to Riverview?" queried
Dick.</p>

<p>"Reckon it has, stranger."</p>

<p>"Do you know if any passengers got off here?"
asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Old Mrs. Harrison got off."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anybody else?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see anybody else,&mdash;but then I wasn't
watchin' very closely," explained the storekeeper.</p>

<p>The only other persons in sight besides the
storekeeper were two children, too small to be
questioned about the stage passengers. The
Rovers looked at each other questioningly.</p>

<p>"Might as well go right through and follow
that stage," said Dick. "If he is on board, there
is no use of letting him get away. If he isn't,
we can come back here and look for him."</p>

<p>The others deemed this good advice, and in
a moment more they left Stockbridge at a rate
of speed which made the storekeeper leap up
from his comfortable chair to gaze after them
in amazement.</p>

<p>"Some of them speeders," he murmured to
himself. "If they don't look out they'll be took
in for breakin' the law."</p>

<p>For a mile or more the road outside of Stockbridge
was fairly good. Beyond, it grew poorer
and poorer, and Tom had to reduce speed once
more for fear of another puncture, or a blowout.
As they sped along the highway all the
youths kept a sharp lookout for Blackie Crowden,
but no one came in sight who answered in
the least to the description of that individual.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'd know him if I saw him," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Sam, who had studied a copy of the man's photograph.</p>

<p>"So would I," answered Tom. "He's got a
face that is somewhat unusual;" and to this Dick
agreed.</p>

<p>On and on they went, the road now being
little more than a country lane. Here the dust
was about six inches deep, and a big cloud floated
behind the machine.</p>

<p>"Almost looks as if we were on the wrong
road again," observed Dick. But hardly had he
spoken when they came out to another crossroad.
Here a signboard pointed to the left, and
the highway was as good as any they had yet
traveled.</p>

<p>"Only one mile more!" cried Sam.</p>

<p>"It won't take long to cover that," answered
Tom, and then turned on the power, and in less
than two minutes more they were approaching
the center of Riverview, a fair-sized town located
on the stream which gave it its name.</p>

<p>"There is the auto-stage, drawn up in front
of the hotel," announced Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes. And it's empty," answered Dick.</p>

<p>The driver of the auto-stage was at the town
pump getting a drink of water. He looked at
the three Rovers curiously as they confronted
him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did I have a passenger that stuttered?" he
repeated in answer to their question. "I sure
did have such a fellow. Why, he stuttered wo'se
than any man I ever heard. And he whistled
too. Awful funny. Why, I had all I could do
to keep from laughin' in his face."</p>

<p>"We want to find that man very much and
right away," announced Dick. "Will you let us
know where you let him off?"</p>

<p>"That's a funny thing, mister," announced the
auto-stage driver. "You see, after we left Stockbridge
I didn't have nobody in but that man. He
paid me the fare to this place before I started.
Then when we was about half-way here I looked
around in the back of the stage and, by gum!
he was gone."</p>

<p>"Gone!" came from the three Rovers.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, he was gone. I looked back and
there he stood on the side of the road. As soon
as he saw that I saw him, he waved his hand
to me and disappeared."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>BACK AT ASHTON</h3>


<p>The three Rovers listened in astonishment to
what the auto-stage driver had to say concerning
the sudden disappearance of Blackie Crowden.</p>

<p>"Then he must have jumped from the stage
while you were running," remarked Dick.</p>

<p>"That's just what he did do, mister. And
he took some chances, too, believe me, for I
wasn't runnin' at less than twenty miles an hour."</p>

<p>"Did he have any baggage with him?" questioned
Tom.</p>

<p>"He had a small handbag, that's all."</p>

<p>"Would you remember the place where he
jumped off?" came from Sam, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was on the road back of here&mdash;just
before you turn into this highway."</p>

<p>"You mean the road that was so thick with
dust?" remarked Tom.</p>

<p>"That's the place. He jumped off at a spot
where the bushes are pretty thick, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
are three trees standin' close together just back
of the bushes."</p>

<p>"I think I know that place," said Dick. "There
is a small white cottage on the hillside just behind
it."</p>

<p>"You've struck it," answered the stage driver.
"I reckon as how he was goin' to call on somebody
at the cottage. But why he didn't ask me
to stop is a mystery. Why! he might have broken
a leg gettin' off that way."</p>

<p>"That man is a criminal, and he did it to throw
you off his track," announced Sam. "Do you
know what I think?" he continued to his
brothers. "I think Blackie Crowden must have
gotten on to the fact that we were at Fernwood,
and made up his mind to clear out as soon as
possible. Then he got afraid that we might question
folks, including this stage driver, and so
jumped from the auto-stage to throw us off his
trail, provided we should follow the stage."</p>

<p>"I guess you have struck the nail on the head,
Sam," answered his oldest brother. "But come
on, let us see if we can find some trace of him."
And in less than a minute more they had turned
their machine around and were heading for the
spot mentioned to them by the stage driver.</p>

<p>It was only a short run, and soon they halted
beside the bushes hedging in three tall trees.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Eagerly they looked around in all directions, but
not a soul was in sight.</p>

<p>"I'm going up to the farmhouse," announced
Sam.</p>

<p>"And I'll go with you," added Dick. "Tom,
you stay down here and take a look around.
If you see anything of him blow the auto horn
three times."</p>

<p>At the farmhouse the two Rovers found themselves
confronted by an elderly man and his wife,
who looked at them rather curiously.</p>

<p>"No, there hasn't been anybody around here
so far as I know," announced the farmer. "We
haven't had a visitor for several days."</p>

<p>"I was out to the well about five minutes ago,"
put in his wife, "and if anybody had come up
to the house or the barn I'd have seen him."</p>

<p>"The fellow we are after is a criminal," explained
Dick, "so if you don't mind we'll take a
look around for him."</p>

<p>"A criminal!" cried the farmer. "Say, that's
bad! Certainly look around all you please, and
I hope if he is anywhere near you'll catch him.
I'd go around with you myself, only I can't
very well on account of this rheumatism of
mine."</p>

<p>The two Rovers walked around the cottage
and the out-buildings but found not the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
trace of Blackie Crowden. Then, rather crestfallen,
they returned to the automobile.</p>

<p>"Perhaps there's some mistake and it wasn't
Crowden at all," was Sam's comment.</p>

<p>"Well, it was a man who stuttered, anyway,
and the general description fitted Crowden," answered
his brother.</p>

<p>When they reached the automobile, they found
Tom gazing curiously at a piece of newspaper
which he had picked up from the ground. It
was rather crumpled, as if it had been used for
wrapping purposes.</p>

<p>"See anything of him, Tom?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"No," was the answer. "But look here. Do
either of you recognize this print?" He held
out the paper, which was the lower half of a
newspaper page. Part of this was devoted to
reading matter and the rest to advertisements.</p>

<p>"Why, sure! I know that paper," cried Dick.
"See that advertisement of The Russel Department
Store and that advertisement of Betts' Shoe
Store? That's a part of the <i>Knoxbury Weekly
Leader</i>."</p>

<p>"That's just what it is!" ejaculated Sam.
"Where did you get that paper, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Found it right here beside the bushes. It
looks as if it had been used to wrap something
in."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then that proves two things," announced
Dick, flatly. "One is that the man who stutters
was really Blackie Crowden, for who else could
have been here with something wrapped in a
Knoxbury newspaper? And the other thing is
that he did as the stage driver said&mdash;left that
stage somewhere near here."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Dick," returned his youngest
brother, "but that doesn't answer the question&mdash;where
is he now?"</p>

<p>"I think he got on to the fact that we were
in Fernwood, and that it was his business to get
out just as quickly as he could," said Tom. "And
if that is true it is more than likely that he is
a good distance away from here by now and
keeping to side roads where he thinks he will
not be followed."</p>

<p>"But what brought him to Fernwood in the
first place?" questioned Sam.</p>

<p>"Give it up. Of course, he may have friends
or relatives here. But I don't know how we are
going to find out the truth about that, and what
good will it do us if we do?"</p>

<p>A half hour was spent in that vicinity, the boys
tramping up and down the road and through the
fields and woods looking for some trace of the
missing man. Then they returned to Fernwood.</p>

<p>"I'm going down to the post-office to post our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
letters," announced Dick. "I'll see if the postmaster
knows anything about Crowden."</p>

<p>The postmaster of Fernwood was a young man
and glad enough to give what information he
could when he heard what Dick had to say.</p>

<p>"Yes, that man was here several times," he
remarked. "He seemed very anxious to get some
letters, and he posted several letters himself, although
whom they were addressed to I don't
know."</p>

<p>"You haven't any idea where he was stopping?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest." And this was all the postmaster
could tell them.</p>

<p>"No use of our staying here any longer," announced
Tom, when the boys had rejoined the
others at the hotel. "I guess Crowden just came
to this out-of-the-way place to get and send mail."</p>

<p>"Don't you think he'll come back, thinking
there'll be some letters for him?" questioned his
wife.</p>

<p>"We'll take care of that," was the reply.
"We'll notify the local authorities and also the
postmaster, so if Crowden turns up again he'll
be arrested at once;" and this matter was attended
to before they left the town.</p>

<p>Chester Waltham grumbled somewhat because
the Rovers had not taken him along on the trip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to Riverview, but the three brothers paid little
attention to this, although Sam showed that he
was rather anxious because of the way in which
Grace stood up for the brother of her seminary
chum.</p>

<p>It had been planned that the tour from Valley
Brook to the west should be taken through Ashton,
so one morning a few days later found the
whole party in the old college town.</p>

<p>"Too bad that Brill and Hope are both closed
for the season," remarked Dora. "We might
have met some of our old friends."</p>

<p>"Well, it doesn't make much difference to
me," grinned back Sam. "It seems like only yesterday
since I graduated."</p>

<p>"I am glad my school days are over," announced
Ada Waltham. "I never did care for
studying."</p>

<p>Before proceeding farther, the Rovers had decided
to call on the Sandersons, so they went
away from the hotel at Ashton, leaving the Walthams
behind. A letter had been sent ahead to
Minnie, so she was not much surprised at their
arrival. Her appearance, however, shocked them
greatly. From looking round and ruddy her
face had taken on a pale and careworn look.</p>

<p>"We are having all sorts of bad luck this year,"
she said, in answer to an inquiry of Dora, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
while the boys had gone off to find Mr. Sanderson,
who was at the barn. "First came the loss
of that money. Then father was taken sick,
and now he tells me that the crops this year
are not going to be nearly as good as usual."</p>

<p>"That is certainly too bad, Minnie," said Dora,
sympathetically. "I wish we could do something
to help you." She paused for a moment. "I
suppose you hear from Songbird occasionally?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he writes to me regularly. He is
hard at work, and last week he sent father a
check for one hundred dollars. This, of course,
is a good deal of money for the poor fellow to
scrape together, but it isn't much towards four
thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"It certainly is too bad about the crops not
being good," said Nellie, who, being the daughter
of a farmer, knew exactly what such a calamity
means to the average man who depends on the
soil for his living.</p>

<p>"Father wouldn't mind it so much if it was
not for this interest on the mortgage. You see
he had expected to pay the whole amount off
and that, of course, would stop the interest. Now
he has to pay the usual amount, two hundred
and forty dollars a year, which, you see, is twenty
dollars a month. It worries him a good deal."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you say Songbird sent him a hundred
dollars?" questioned Grace, curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes. It was money he had earned and some
that his folks had given him. I am glad to say
father didn't think much of accepting it at first,"
added Minnie, her face brightening a little. "But
poor John urged it, so that at last he took it and
sent it over to the bank."</p>

<p>"Then I suppose Songbird and your father are
on fairly good terms now," remarked Dora.</p>

<p>"No, I am sorry to say that is not true, Dora.
At first father seemed to get over it, but lately
he has been as bitter as ever. You see, his sickness,
and the bad crops, and the interest money
to be paid on the mortgage, worry him a great
deal, and he takes it all out on poor John. He
sticks to it that John should have been more careful
while he was carrying such a large amount."
Minnie turned her face away and two tears stole
down her cheeks. "It's a shame&mdash;an awful,
burning shame! But what in the world am I
to do?"</p>

<p>"It surely is too bad, Minnie," said Dora, kindly,
placing her arm around the girl's waist, while
Nellie and Grace looked on sympathetically. "If
we could help you at all we would do it. We
have some news of Blackie Crowden, and the
others have gone out to tell your father about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
it," and then she related what had occurred during
the stop at Fernwood.</p>

<p>"Oh! if only they could find that fellow and
get back the money!" sobbed Minnie. "But maybe
the most of it has been spent," she added,
dolefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, let us hope not!" cried Nellie. "He
couldn't spend any such amount as that in so
short a time."</p>

<p>"He might if he drank and gambled it away,"
put in her sister. "Oh, wouldn't it be too bad
if they did catch this Blackie Crowden and then
found that he had squandered all that money!"</p>

<h3>AT THE FESTIVAL</h3>


<p>While Dora and her cousins were talking to
Minnie the others had sought out Mr. Sanderson,
who was down in the barn superintending
the stowing away of some grain. The farmer
listened with interest to what they had to tell
him about Blackie Crowden, but shook his head
dolefully.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty well satisfied that they'll never
get that money back for me now," he announced.
"A fellow of that character would use up cash
about as fast as he could lay hands on it."</p>

<p>"Well, let us live in hopes," returned Dick,
not knowing what else to say.</p>

<p>The farmer asked them about their tour, and
said he trusted that they would have a good
time. Then Sam ventured to mention Songbird.</p>

<p>"Better not talk to me about that young man,"
declared Mr. Sanderson, drawing down the corners
of his mouth. "He may mean well enough,
but he's not my kind, and I've told Minnie she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
had better stop having him call and also stop
writing to him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Sanderson! I think you are doing
our chum an injustice," cried Sam. "It wasn't
his fault that he was robbed of that four thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"Humph! That's as how you look at it,"
grumbled the farmer. "I've said what I think,
and I'll stick to it." And nothing that the Rovers
could say would alter his decision in this matter.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry for Minnie I really don't
know how to express myself," were Dora's
words, when the party were once more on the
way to the Ashton hotel. "If her father compels
her to give up Songbird it will just about
break her heart."</p>

<p>"I don't believe she's the one to give up Songbird,"
answered Sam. "She isn't that kind of
girl," and he looked at Grace. But her eyes at
that moment were turned in another direction.
He followed the look and saw that she was gazing
at Chester Waltham, who, with his sister,
had driven their car to meet the others.</p>

<p>"There is one thing about this whole matter
that worries me," said Dick, "and that is that
when they catch this Blackie Crowden&mdash;and I
think they'll land on the fellow sooner or later&mdash;most
of the money may be gone. There will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
some satisfaction in placing such a rascal behind
the bars, but that won't give Mr. Sanderson his
cash back nor lift that mortgage."</p>

<p>"We've just got news and we thought we
would let you know about it," cried Ada Waltham,
as the runabout came to a standstill close
to the other automobiles. "There is to be a grand
festival at Larkinburg this evening, and if it
is not necessary to stay in Ashton to-night we
might as well go to that place and attend the
festival. I received a letter at the Ashton post-office
from two girls who used to go to Hope,
and they are to be at the affair, and they write
that it will be well worth attending."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, let us go to Larkinburg by all
means!" cried Grace. "I know the two girls&mdash;Jennie
Cross and Mabel Stanford. The festival
will certainly be well worth while if they say so."</p>

<p>"Let me see&mdash;how many miles is it to Larkinburg?"
questioned Tom.</p>

<p>"Only sixty, so we can make the run with
ease if we start directly after lunch," answered
Chester Waltham.</p>

<p>The matter was talked over for a few minutes,
and as a result it was decided to go ahead
and make the town mentioned in ample time to
attend the festival.</p>

<p>"They are going to have a concert and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
outdoor tableaux, with refreshments," said
Grace. "Ada was telling me all about it."</p>

<p>"Well, that will be much better than staying
in Ashton doing nothing," returned Dora. "And,
besides, we must be getting along on our trip.
Dick says we are really a day behind in our
schedule."</p>

<p>During the stop at the Ashton hotel for lunch,
Chester Waltham had been very attentive to
Grace and had asked her if she did not wish to
change places with his sister on the run to Larkinburg;
but she had declined, offering some
excuse which was far from satisfactory to the
young millionaire.</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to put in part of
this tour with me," he had said, rather reproachfully.
"Besides, if you will come in with me it
will give Ada a chance to visit with the others."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll ride with you some time," Grace
had answered. "I want Ada to have as good a
time as any of us."</p>

<p>The long hours spent on the road had proved
rather tiring to Mrs. Stanhope and Mrs. Laning,
and when Larkinburg was reached they were glad
enough to rest in a comfortable room which
Dick engaged for them.</p>

<p>"You young folks can go to the festival," said
Mrs. Stanhope, with a smile. "We are going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
to stay here and go to bed early;" and so it was
arranged.</p>

<p>The festival was held in a large grove bordering
a beautiful stream and located some distance
from the center of the town. As soon as our
friends had arrived they had called up the two
former students of Hope, and it had been decided
that these girls, along with their escorts,
should join the others and all should attend the
festival together.</p>

<p>"We can easily pack the whole crowd in our
three cars," announced Dick.</p>

<p>"I can't carry any extra people in my runabout,"
complained Chester Waltham. "Of
course, one of the fellows might stand on the
running board, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We'll take them, don't worry," answered
Sam. "We've got some vacant seats, you know,
and four extra won't count."</p>

<p>The girls from Hope were a jolly pair and so
were the two young men who accompanied them.
All got in the Rovers' machines, and away they
went, followed closely by the Waltham runabout.
A parking space had been set aside, and there
our friends found themselves surrounded by machines
of all sorts, and a jolly, laughing crowd
numbering several thousands of people.</p>

<p>"Oh, how pretty!" burst from Grace's lips, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
they strolled toward the place where the concert
and the tableaux were to be given.</p>

<p>A stage had been constructed among some
trees and bushes with a background of the river,
and here scores of lamps and lanterns twinkled
forth. The seats were placed along a sloping
bank, and soon the whole crowd was gathered
to listen to the opening number of the concert.</p>

<p>As soon as the machines were parked Chester
Waltham, almost ignoring his sister, had
devoted his attention to Grace, doing this while
Sam was busy talking over some matters with
his brothers. Waltham had walked over to the
seats with Grace beside him, and now he saw
to it that she was placed where he could talk to
her with ease. This, of course, did not particularly
suit Sam, but he was helpless in the matter
and so made the best of it.</p>

<p>The concert was a fine one and the tableaux,
which were interspersed between the various
musical numbers, were intensely interesting.</p>

<p>"Certainly well worth attending," was Tom's
comment, when that portion of the festival came
to an end amid a loud clapping of hands.</p>

<p>"And now for some refreshments," announced
Dick. "Come on, let us hurry or the tables may
all be filled," for some long tables decorated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
lanterns had been set under the trees at one side
of the grove.</p>

<p>"My! but it is rather chilly here," was Grace's
comment, when they were moving toward the
tables. "I feel positively cold."</p>

<p>"Didn't you bring your jacket?" questioned
Sam.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I left it in the auto."</p>

<p>"I'll go and get it," he returned, and ran off
to procure the garment. He found that more
machines had come in, and it was some little
while before he could locate their automobile
and pick out the jacket.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Chester Waltham, leaving
his sister with the other girls from Hope, had
gone on with Grace and seated her at one of the
tables, with the others of the party opposite.
There was but one vacant seat left next to Grace,
and this the young millionaire appropriated.</p>

<p>"I don't know what Sam will do when he gets
here," remarked Grace, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess he'll find a seat somewhere," answered
Chester Waltham, coolly.</p>

<p>The youngest Rover was rather surprised on
getting back to find every seat filled and the
young millionaire sitting beside the girl who was
so dear to his heart, but he made no comment.
He helped Grace don the jacket, and then stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
back until there was a vacant seat at a table some
distance away.</p>

<p>"I think it was rather mean of Chester Waltham
to appropriate that seat," whispered Nellie
to Dora while they were being served.</p>

<p>"I think so myself, Nellie," was the low reply.</p>

<p>At last the festival came to an end, and all
those in the crowd prepared to go home.</p>

<p>"I hope you enjoyed your refreshments," said
Sam, rather coolly, as he came up to Grace's
side.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I enjoyed them very much," answered
the girl. She looked at him rather pointedly.
"Didn't you think the sandwiches and
cake and other things were very nice?"</p>

<p>"Nice enough," he grumbled. "Come on, let
us get back to the hotel, I'm as tired as a dog,"
and he started to walk away, leaving the others
to follow him.</p>

<p>His words and the manner in which they were
spoken rather nettled Grace, and she walked
toward the automobiles in silence, with the others
in front and behind her. But Chester Waltham
remained at her side, and as they approached
the machines he caught her by the arm.</p>

<p>"Say, Grace, come on and take a ride with
me," he half whispered. "It's a beautiful night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Come on, you don't want to go back to the hotel
yet."</p>

<p>"But what about Ada?" she questioned.</p>

<p>"Oh, she can take your place in one of the
other autos, can't she?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;suppose so," faltered Grace. She
hardly knew how to go on. She did not wish
particularly to take a ride with Waltham, and,
at the same time, she was hurt over the way
Sam had spoken to her.</p>

<p>"See here, Sis," cried the young millionaire,
"I am going to take Miss Laning back in my
runabout. She says you can take her place with
the Rovers."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, Chester," answered the sister.
"Hope you have a nice time of it," she added
to Grace.</p>

<p>There was a large crowd down among the
automobiles, and our friends had all they could
do in the semi-darkness to get their machines out
on the road in safety.</p>

<p>"Where is Grace?" demanded Sam, as some
of the others came up to him. He had just
turned on the lights of both cars.</p>

<p>"She is going to ride back with Chester,"
answered Ada Waltham. "You'll have to let me
ride back with you," and she laughed lightly.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right. Come ahead," returned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
youngest Rover. He spoke as lightly as he could.
He did not wish to let the others know his true
feelings. There was a strange bitterness in his
heart, and for the moment he wished that he
had never come on this tour.</p>

<h3>A CALL FOR ASSISTANCE</h3>


<p>Ada Waltham did all she could to make
herself agreeable to Sam and the others, but
the youngest Rover was in no mood for raillery,
and on the way back to Larkinburg had
but little to say.</p>

<p>Chester Waltham had lost no time in assisting
Grace into his runabout and in getting his car
out of the congestion in the parking space. Then
he put on speed, and soon the pair were whirled
away out of the sight of the others.</p>

<p>"It's a dandy night for a ride," was Tom's
remark. There was some moonshine, and the
stars glittered clear in the heavens overhead.</p>

<p>"That is true, Tom," answered his wife, "but
don't you think we had better get back to the hotel
and go to bed? I heard Dick say something
about a long day of it to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Nellie, we'll get back. It wouldn't
be fair to go off and leave mother and Mrs. Stanhope
alone."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>When they reached the hotel at Larkinburg
the Rovers expected to find the Waltham runabout
in the garage, and they were consequently
somewhat surprised when they saw no sign of
the machine.</p>

<p>"We certainly couldn't have passed them on
the road," observed Dick. He turned to his
youngest brother. "You didn't see them, did
you?"</p>

<p>"No. They went on ahead," answered Sam,
shortly; and his manner of speech showed that
he was thoroughly out of sorts.</p>

<p>Having placed the touring cars in the care of
the garage keeper, the Rovers joined the others
on the piazza of the hotel. Then Dora slipped
upstairs to see if her mother and Mrs. Laning
were all right. She found both of them sleeping
soundly, and did not disturb them.</p>

<p>Sam could not content himself with sitting
down, and so lounged around in one place and
another, and finally said he would go inside and
write a letter to the folks at home. He was still
writing when Tom came in to join him.</p>

<p>"Sam, did Chester Waltham say anything
about where he was going to take Grace?" asked
Tom, as he sat down beside his brother.</p>

<p>"No, he didn't say a word to me," was the
short reply, and Sam went on writing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did Grace say anything?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Tom said nothing for a moment, drumming
his fingers on the writing table. At last he heaved
something of a sigh.</p>

<p>"Seems to me if they were going on a long
ride they might have said something to us about
it," he observed. "Nellie is rather worried."</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess they've got a right to take a
ride if they want to," came rather crossly from
Sam. He finished his letter with a flourish,
folded it, and rammed it into an envelope which
he quickly addressed.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, but&mdash;&mdash;" Tom did not finish,
and as Sam, after stamping his letter, arose, he
did the same. "I wonder if we had better stay
up for them."</p>

<p>"I think I'll go to bed."</p>

<p>"Sam!" and Tom looked sharply at his
younger brother.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the use of staying up?"</p>

<p>"A whole lot of use, Sam Rover, and you
know it. If I were you I wouldn't let Chester
Waltham ride over me."</p>

<p>"Who says I am letting him ride over me?"
retorted Sam; and now his manner showed that
he was quite angry.</p>

<p>"I say so," answered Tom, bluntly. "If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
have got half the sand in you that I always
thought you had, you wouldn't stand for it. All
of us know how matters were going on between
you and Grace. Now to let this fellow step in,
even if he is a young millionaire, is downright
foolish. If you really care for Grace it's up to
you to go in and take her."</p>

<p>"Yes, but suppose that she cares for Waltham
and his money more than she cares for me?"
asked Sam, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Do you think Grace is the kind of a girl to
be caught by money, Sam?" and now, as the two
were in a deserted part of the hallway, Tom
took his brother by both arms and held him
firmly.</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, I&mdash;I can't say that exactly," faltered
Sam. "But just the same, why does she favor
him at all?"</p>

<p>"Maybe it's because you haven't been as outspoken
as you ought to be. It's one thing for
a girl to know what you think of her, but just
the same the average girl wants you to tell her
so in plain words. Now, it may not be any of
my business, but you know that I want you to
be happy, and that I am unusually interested because
of Nellie. It seems to me if I were you
I'd go to Grace the first chance I had and have
a clear understanding."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't go to her now. She's out with
Waltham," stammered Sam.</p>

<p>"Then hang around until they get back and
see to it that you have a chance to talk with
her before she goes to her room," returned Tom;
and then, as some other people came up, the
conversation had to come to an end.</p>

<p>A half hour passed and Ada Waltham excused
herself. "Chester and Grace must be having
a fine ride," she observed on retiring, "otherwise
they would have returned by this time."</p>

<p>"Maybe they had a breakdown," observed
Dick. "I've been told that some of the roads
around here are far from good."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that!" cried the girl. "Chester
hates to have to make any repairs when he is
alone. Time and again he has run to a garage
on a flat tire rather than put another one on
himself."</p>

<p>Another half hour dragged by, and now Dora
turned to whisper to Dick.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we had better retire?" she
asked. "I never supposed Grace was going to
stay out as late as this."</p>

<p>"No, we'll stay up," he answered. "Nellie
has told Tom that she isn't going to bed until
her sister gets back, so it won't do for us to
leave them here on the piazza alone."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Rover! Telephone call for Mr. Rover!"
came the announcement from a bellboy, as he
appeared upon the piazza.</p>

<p>"Which Mr. Rover?" demanded Sam, eagerly.</p>

<p>"The party said any of 'em would do," answered
the bellboy.</p>

<p>"I'll go," said Sam, eagerly, before either of
his brothers or their wives could speak.</p>

<p>"All right, Sam. I'll follow in case you want
me or any of the others," answered Tom.</p>

<p>The telephone booths were located in the lobby
of the hotel, and Sam was quickly shown to one
of them. While he talked Tom stood by, but
caught only a few words of what was said.</p>

<p>"Hello!"</p>

<p>"Oh, is this you, Sam?" came over the wire in
Grace's voice. "I'm so glad! I have been trying
to get somebody for the last ten minutes but
they couldn't give me the hotel connection."</p>

<p>"Where are you?" questioned the youth. "Has
anything happened?" for the tone of the girl's
voice indicated that she was very much agitated.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam! I want you or some of the others
to come and get me," cried Grace. "The runabout
has broken down, and I don't think Mr.
Waltham can fix it. And we are miles and miles
away from Larkinburg!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"A breakdown, eh? Why, sure, I'll come and
get you, Grace. Where are you?"</p>

<p>"I am at a farmhouse on the road between
Dennville and Corbytown&mdash;the Akerson place.
If you come, take the road to Dennville and then
drive toward Corbytown. We'll hang a lantern
on the stepping block, so you will know where
to stop."</p>

<p>"All right, Grace, I'll be there just as soon as
I can make it," answered Sam; and then he added
quickly: "You weren't hurt when the breakdown
happened, were you?"</p>

<p>"Not very much, although I was a good deal
shaken up. Mr. Waltham had his face and his
hand scraped by the broken wind-shield."</p>

<p>"Well, you take good care of yourself, and
I'll start right away," returned the youngest Rover,
and after a few words more hung up the
receiver.</p>

<p>It did not take Sam long to acquaint the others
with what had occurred, and then he ran down
to the hotel garage to get out one of the touring
cars.</p>

<p>"Don't you think I had better go along?"
asked Tom. "Chester Waltham may be in a fix
and need assistance. And, besides, they may both
be more hurt than Grace said."</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess you'd better come," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
his brother. And soon, having received directions
from the garage keeper as to how to get
to Dennville, the pair were on the way.</p>

<p>"How did Grace seem to be when you spoke
to her?" questioned Tom, as Sam ran the car
as rapidly as the semi-darkness of the night permitted.</p>

<p>"She seemed to be all unstrung," was Sam's
thoughtful reply.</p>

<p>"Then the accident may have been worse than
she admitted, Sam."</p>

<p>"I hope not, but we'll soon see." And then, as
a straight stretch of fairly good road appeared
before them, Sam turned on the power and the
touring car sped onward faster than ever.</p>

<p>Inside of half an hour they reached Dennville,
a sleepy little town, located in the midst of
a number of hills. All the houses were dark
and the stores closed up, and not a soul was
in sight. They ran into the tiny public square
and there found several signboards.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" cried Sam. "Corbytown four
miles this way," and he pointed with his hand.</p>

<p>"We'll look at the other signboards first to
see whether there is another road," answered his
brother. But there was only the one, and so
Sam turned the touring car into this, and they
sped forward once more, but now at a reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
rate of speed, for the road was decidedly hilly
and far from good.</p>

<p>"What possessed Waltham to take such a road
as this," remarked Tom, after they had passed
a particularly bad spot.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me!" was the reply. "It's no wonder
he had a breakdown if he took this road on
high speed."</p>

<p>They were going up a long hill. At the top
a large and well-kept farm spread out, and, beyond,
the hill dropped away on a road that was
worse than ever.</p>

<p>"Hello! there's a light!" cried Tom, as they
approached the house belonging to the farm.</p>

<p>"I see it," answered his brother; and in a few
seconds more they ran up to the horse-block and
brought the touring car to a standstill, Sam, at
the same time, sounding the horn.</p>

<p>But the summons was unnecessary, for their
approach had been eagerly looked for by Grace,
and hardly had the machine come to a standstill
when she flew out of the farmhouse to meet
them.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad you've come!" she burst out.
"If you hadn't, I don't know what I should have
done!" She was somewhat hysterical and on
the verge of tears.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that you're not hurt, Grace?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
asked Sam, quickly; and as he spoke he caught
her by one hand and placed an arm on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't think I am hurt, Sam," she faltered,
and then looked rather tearfully into his
face. "But it was an awful experience&mdash;awful!"
and then as he drew a little closer she suddenly
burst into a fit of weeping and rested her head
on his shoulder.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>SAM FREES HIS MIND</h3>


<p>In spite of his fun-loving disposition, Tom
Rover was a very wise young man, so as soon
as he saw Grace resting on his brother's shoulder
he promptly turned away, to interview the
farmer and his wife who lived in the farmhouse
and who had answered the girl's knock on their
door.</p>

<p>"I can't tell much about the accident," said
Mr. Akerson. "Me and my wife were just goin'
to bed when the young lady knocked on the door
and begged us to take her in, and then asked if
we had a telephone. She said she had been in
an automobile breakdown, but she didn't give us
many particulars, except to say that she thought
the front axle of the machine was broken."</p>

<p>"Well, a broken axle is bad enough," was
Tom's prompt comment. "They are lucky that
no necks were broken."</p>

<p>"The poor girl was dreadfully shook up," put
in Mrs. Akerson. "She just went on somethin'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
terrible. I had all I could do to quiet her at
first."</p>

<p>"Didn't the young man come here with her?"
questioned Tom.</p>

<p>"No. She said she had left him down on
the road with the machine. She said he was all
worked up over the accident."</p>

<p>"I should think he would be," returned Tom,
and said no more on the subject. Yet he thought
it very strange that Chester Waltham had not
accompanied Grace to the farmhouse and thus
made certain that help was summoned.</p>

<p>Tom and his brother had entered the sitting-room
of the farmhouse. Next to it was a lit-up
dining-room and to this Sam and Grace had
walked, the latter between her sobs telling of
what had happened.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam, it was dreadful!" cried Grace.
"Mr. Waltham was so reckless. I couldn't understand
him at all. When I said I would ride
with him I supposed we were going right back
to the hotel. But on the way he said it was too
fine a night to go in yet, and begged me to go
a little farther, and so finally I consented. Then
he drove the car on and on, ever so many miles,
until we reached Dennville."</p>

<p>"But if you didn't want to go that far, Grace,
why didn't you tell him?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did&mdash;several times. But he wouldn't listen
to me. Of course, I didn't want to act rude,
and when I told him to turn back he only laughed
at me. Then, when we got to Dennville, and I
told him that I positively would not go any farther,
he said, 'Oh, yes, you will. We are going
to have a good, long ride. I am going to make
you pay up in full for not riding with me
before.'"</p>

<p>"The mean fellow!" murmured Sam. "I'd
like to punch him for that."</p>

<p>"Oh, but, Sam! that wasn't the worst of it,"
went on the girl; and now she blushed painfully
and hung her head. "Then he started up on this
side road and he ran the car as fast as ever.
I was dreadfully scared, but he only laughed and
told me to enjoy myself, and when the car
bumped over some stones, and I was thrown
against him, he put his arm around me and&mdash;and
he did his best to kiss me!"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"But I didn't allow it. I pushed him away,
and when he laughed at me I told him that if
he tried it again I would box his ears. Then,
just after we had passed this place, he reached
over and caught hold of me and tried to pull me
toward him. Then I boxed him, just as I had
said I would. That made him furious, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
put on a burst of speed, and the next minute
there was a terrible bump and a crash, and both
of us were almost thrown out of the car. The
wind-shield was broken and also, I think, the
front axle, and he was scratched in several places.
Oh, it was awful!" And again Grace hid her
face on Sam's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, it served him right if he got hurt and
if his runabout was ruined," was the youth's
comment. He drew Grace closer to him than
ever. "Then you didn't really care for him?"
he whispered.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam, Sam! how can you ask such a question?"
she murmured.</p>

<p>"Because I didn't know. I thought&mdash;&mdash; You
see, he&mdash;he is a millionaire, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, Sam Rover! do you think that money
would make any difference to me?" and now she
raised her face to look him full in the eyes.</p>

<p>"I am mighty glad to know it hasn't made any
difference," he returned quickly; and then caught
and held her tight once more.</p>

<p>"I suppose you young men are goin' back to
help the fellow with his busted machine," remarked
Mr. Akerson to Tom.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I suppose so," returned Tom, slowly, and
then looked toward Sam and Grace.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want to go back!" cried the girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
quickly. "I want to return to the hotel in Larkinburg."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll take you back, Grace," answered
Sam. "If you say so, we'll leave Waltham
right where he is."</p>

<p>"I think it would be the right thing to do,
Sam, under ordinary circumstances," was the reply.
"But then we mustn't forget about Ada.
She will be greatly worried if I come back
and let her know that we left her brother out
here on the open road with a broken machine."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we'll do, Grace. You stay
here and Tom and I will go down and see what
Waltham has got to say for himself." He turned
to the people of the house. "She can stay here
a little longer, can't she? We'll make it all
right with you."</p>

<p>"Certainly she can stay," answered Mr. Akerson.
"And there won't be anything to pay outside
of the telephone toll, and that's only twenty
cents."</p>

<p>"Please don't stay too long," implored Grace,
as the two Rovers hurried away.</p>

<p>"Not a minute longer than is necessary," returned
Sam.</p>

<p>On the way down the hill to where the accident
had occurred Sam gave his brother the particulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of the affair, not mincing matters so
far as it concerned Chester Waltham.</p>

<p>"I was thinking that that was about the way
it would turn out," was Tom's dry comment.
"With so much money, Waltham thinks he can
do about as he pleases. I reckon now, Sam, you
are sorry you didn't talk to Grace before."</p>

<p>"I sure am, Tom!" was the reply, and Sam's
tones showed what a weight had been taken from
his heart. "I'm going to fix it up with Grace
before another twenty-four hours pass."</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk, boy! Go to it! I
wish you every success!" and Tom clapped his
brother on the shoulder affectionately.</p>

<p>Even though all the lights were out, it did not
take the two Rovers long to locate the disabled
runabout, which rested among some stones on the
side of the highway. As Grace had stated, the
wind-shield was a mass of smashed glass, and
the front axle had broken close to the left
wheel.</p>

<p>"They can certainly be thankful they didn't
break their necks," was Tom's comment, as he
walked around the wreck.</p>

<p>"Waltham doesn't seem to be anywhere around
here," returned Sam. "Wonder where he went
to?"</p>

<p>Both looked up and down the highway, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
presently saw a figure approaching from down
the road. It proved to be Chester Waltham.
He was capless and walked with a limp.</p>

<p>"Hello! Who are you?" challenged the young
millionaire, and then as he drew closer he added:
"Oh, the Rovers, eh? Did Grace get you on the
'phone?"</p>

<p>"She did," answered Sam, and then added
sharply: "You've made a nice mess of it here,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Say, I don't want any such talk from you,"
blustered the rich young man. Evidently he
was in far from a good humor.</p>

<p>"I'll say what I please, Waltham, without asking
your permission," continued the youngest Rover.
"You had no right to bring Miss Laning
away out here against her wishes. It was a contemptible
thing to do."</p>

<p>"You talk as if you were my master," retorted
Chester Waltham. "This isn't any of your affair
and you keep out of it."</p>

<p>"We are perfectly willing to keep out of it
if you say so, Waltham," broke in Tom. "We
came down here merely to see if we could help
you in any way. But I see your front axle is
broken, and you will have to get the garage people
to help you out with that."</p>

<p>"Where's Grace?" asked the young millionaire.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
The subject of the broken-down runabout
did not seem to interest him.</p>

<p>"She is up at the farmhouse on the hill," answered
Tom.</p>

<p>"And we are going to take her back to the
Larkinburg hotel in our auto," added Sam.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, then, go ahead and do it."</p>

<p>"Do you want to ride with us?" questioned
Tom.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I do. I'll stay here and
take care of my runabout. If you'll tell my sister
that I'm all right, that is all I want."</p>

<p>"Very well, just as you say," answered Tom.
He took his brother by the arm. "Come on,
Sam, there is no use of wasting time here."</p>

<p>"I'll be with you in a minute, Tom," was the
younger brother's reply. "You go on ahead, I
want to say just a few words more to Waltham."</p>

<p>"No use of your getting into a fight, Sam,"
returned Tom in a low voice.</p>

<p>"There won't be any fight unless he starts it."</p>

<p>Tom walked slowly up the road, and Sam
turned back to where Chester Waltham had settled
himself on the mud-guard of the broken-down
runabout.</p>

<p>"See here, Waltham, I want to say a few
words more to you," began Sam, and his tone
of voice was such that the young millionaire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
leaped at once to his feet. "I want to warn you
about how you treat Miss Laning in the future."</p>

<p>"To warn me!" repeated Chester Waltham,
not knowing what else to say.</p>

<p>"Exactly! Up at the farmhouse she told me
all of what took place between you. She was
all unstrung and quite hysterical. Now this won't
do at all, and I want you to know it. After this
if you are going to travel with us you've got to
act the gentleman and treat her like a lady."</p>

<p>"Humph!"</p>

<p>"No 'humph' about it. I mean just what I
say. If you don't behave yourself and don't
treat her like a lady I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what will you do?" sneered Chester
Waltham.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," and now Sam shook
his finger in the young millionaire's face. "I'll
give you the soundest thrashing you ever had
in your life!"</p>

<p>"Ah! do you mean to threaten me?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do."</p>

<p>"When it comes to a thrashing, maybe two
can play at that game," observed the young millionaire;
but it was plainly to be seen that Sam's
decided stand had disconcerted him.</p>

<p>"All right, Waltham, I'll be ready for you.
But remember what I said. We came out here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
to have a good time, and I am not going to allow
you to spoil it for Miss Laning or for anybody
else."</p>

<p>"Humph! you make me tired," sneered the
rich young man. "Go on, I don't want to be
bothered with you any longer. The whole bunch
of you is too namby-pamby for me. I think my
sister and I could have a much better time if
we weren't with you."</p>

<p>"As far as you personally are concerned, you
can't leave us any too quickly to suit me," returned
Sam.</p>

<p>"Is that so? Well, I guess you can call it off
then so far as my sister and I are concerned.
But if you think, Rover, that you have seen the
last of this affair you are mistaken," went on
the young millionaire, pointedly. "You think you
are going to run things to suit yourself, don't
you? Well, I'll put a spoke in your wheel&mdash;a
spoke that you never dreamed of! You just
wait and see!" and then Chester Waltham turned
back and sat down once more on his wrecked
runabout, leaving Sam to walk up the road to
rejoin Tom in a very thoughtful mood.</p>

<h3>A TELEGRAM FROM NEW YORK</h3>


<p>It was not until the small hours of the morning
that the two Rovers and Grace returned to
the hotel in Larkinburg. They found Dick and
his wife and Nellie anxiously awaiting their return.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am so glad that you weren't hurt,"
cried Nellie, as she embraced her sister. "I was
so worried," and she hugged her again and again.</p>

<p>"You can rest assured, Nellie, that I'll never go
out with Chester Waltham again! Never!" cried
Grace. "Come on, I am going to my room.
Good-night, everybody," she called back, and in
another moment had retired from their view, followed
by her sister.</p>

<p>"Why, Sam! what does it mean?" cried Dora,
as she looked on in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"It means that Chester Waltham ought to have
had a good thrashing," declared the youngest
Rover; and then he and Tom told of what had
occurred.</p>

<p>"I guess it will be a good job done if we part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
company with the Walthams," remarked Dick,
after the subject had been discussed for some
time. "He is not of our class, even if he has
money."</p>

<p>"I feel rather sorry for his sister," added
Dora. "Although once in a while she shows the
same haughtiness of manner that Chester displays.
It's too bad, too, for they might be really
nice company."</p>

<p>With so much excitement going on, it was
small wonder that the Rover party did not come
downstairs that morning until quite late. Sam
was the first to show himself, he being anxious
to know how Grace had fared.</p>

<p>"Here is a letter for your brother, Mr. Rover,"
said the clerk at the desk, when Sam approached
him. "It was left here by that Mr.
Waltham."</p>

<p>"Hand it over," returned the youth, and then
added: "Did Mr. Waltham bring his wrecked
runabout to the garage here?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, he just came here, got his sister, paid
his bill, and went off."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see." Sam could not help but show
his surprise. "I'll take this letter to my brother,"
he added, and hurried off.</p>

<p>The communication was a short one, yet the
Rovers and the others read it with interest. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
it Chester Waltham said that in consideration of
the way he had been treated by some members
of the party he considered it advisable for his
sister and himself to continue their tour separately.
He added that he trusted Miss Laning
did not feel any ill effects because of the breakdown
on the road.</p>

<p>"And just to think that Ada went off without
saying good-bye!" cried Grace, when she saw the
letter. "I didn't think she would be quite so
mean as that."</p>

<p>"Probably she took her brother's part. She
usually did," returned her sister. "Well, I think
we are well rid of them."</p>

<p>"So do I," put in Tom. "Personally I don't
care if we never see them again."</p>

<p>"He said he was going to put a spoke in our
wheel," mused Sam. "I wonder if he'll dare
to do anything to harm us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's likely he was talking through his
hat," returned Dick; but for once the oldest Rover
was mistaken.</p>

<p>Now that our friends were by themselves there
seemed to be a general air of relief. The only
one of the party who was rather quiet was Grace,
but Sam did everything he could to make it pleasant
for her, and before nightfall she was as jolly
as ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>The run during that day was through a particularly
beautiful section of the country, and
about one o'clock they stopped in a grove and
partook of a lunch which had been put up for
them at the Larkinburg hotel. Then they moved
forward once again, with Dick and Tom at the
steering wheels of the cars.</p>

<p>"Still seventy-three miles to go if we want
to make Etoria to-day," announced Dick, after
consulting the guide book. "I'm afraid that will
be quite a ride for you ladies," he added, turning
to Mrs. Stanhope and Mrs. Laning.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, let us go on to Etoria by all means,"
pleaded Sam.</p>

<p>"Any particular reason for going to that city?"
asked Tom, quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I've got a reason, but I'm not going
to tell you," returned his younger brother. And
then, as both Dick and Tom looked at him questioningly,
he blushed and turned away.</p>

<p>"Oh, go ahead. I think I can stand it," said
Mrs. Stanhope, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I am getting used to traveling," declared
Mrs. Laning. "It's much more comfortable than
I at first supposed it would be."</p>

<p>Nightfall found them still ten miles from Etoria
and Dick asked the others if they wished to
stop anywhere along the way for supper. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
declared, however, that they would rather keep
on until the city was reached.</p>

<p>"They tell me that they have got a dandy hotel
there&mdash;something new," said Sam. "We
ought to get first-class accommodations there."</p>

<p>Etoria was a city of some fifty thousand inhabitants,
with a long main street brightly lighted
up. The new hotel was opposite a beautiful
public park, an ideal location. Sam seemed to
be in unusual haste to finish his supper, and immediately
it was over he asked Grace if she would
not take a walk with him.</p>

<p>"We are going to do up the town, so don't
worry if we get back a little late," he told Mrs.
Laning, and then whispered something in her ear
which made her smile and gaze at him fondly.</p>

<p>They pursued their way along the main street
of the town, and while doing so the youngest Rover
kept his eyes on the various shops that were
passed. At last they came to a large jewelry
establishment and here he brought the girl to a
halt.</p>

<p>"It's open!" he cried. "That's what I call
luck! I was afraid they would all be closed."</p>

<p>Grace looked at the store, and at the display
of jewelry in the window, and then looked at
Sam.</p>

<p>"I guess you know what it's going to be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Grace," he said rather tenderly, and looked her
full in the eyes. "I want you to have just as
good a one as Dora or Nellie."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam! I&mdash;I don't understand," she stammered.</p>

<p>"It's an engagement ring. We are going in
here and see what sort of rings this man has
got. It looks like a reliable place."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam!" and now, blushing deeply, Grace
clung to his arm. "An engagement ring?"</p>

<p>"Sure! You ought to have had it long ago,
then maybe we wouldn't have had any trouble."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any trouble, Sam&mdash;at least, I
didn't make any trouble," she repeated; and
then, as he caught her arm and dragged her into
the shop, she murmured: "Oh, I&mdash;I feel so funny
to go into a store for a thing like that! Don't
you think I had better wait outside?"</p>

<p>"You can if you want to, after the jeweler has
measured your finger, Grace. But what's the
use of being so backward? As soon as we get
back home you are going to be Mrs. Sam Rover,
so you might as well get used to such things first
as last."</p>

<p>Fortunately for the young couple it was a very
elderly man&mdash;quite fatherly in appearance&mdash;who
came to wait on them.</p>

<p>"A diamond ring?" he queried. "Why, certainly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
I'll be pleased to show everything we
have;" and then he measured Grace's finger, and
brought forth several trays of glittering gems.</p>

<p>Grace would have been satisfied with almost
any of the rings, but Sam was rather critical and
insisted upon obtaining a beautiful blue-white
diamond which was almost the counterpart of the
stone Dick had bestowed upon Dora.</p>

<p>"Now you've got to promise to have this engraved
by eight o'clock to-morrow morning,"
said the youngest Rover to the jeweler. "We
are on an automobile tour and we can't wait
any longer than that." And thereupon the shopkeeper
promised that the order should be duly
filled.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam, how extravagant you are!" murmured
Grace, when the pair were returning to
the hotel. "Why, that ring cost a dreadful lot
of money." Her eyes were shining like stars.</p>

<p>"It isn't a bit too good for such a girl as you,"
he declared stoutly, and then gave her hand a
squeeze that meant a great deal.</p>

<p>When they left Etoria the next morning Sam
had the engagement ring tucked safely away in
his pocket. He had confided in Dick, and the
oldest Rover managed it so that that noon they
stopped at a large country hotel and obtained the
use of a private dining-room. This, Sam had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
decorated with flowers, and just before the meal
commenced he slipped the engagement ring upon
Grace's finger.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam! Oh, Grace!" shrieked Nellie when
she saw the sparkling circlet on her sister's
finger.</p>

<p>"Oh! so that's what's going on, is it?" cried
Dora, joyfully. "Grace, allow me to congratulate
you," and then she kissed the girl and immediately
afterward kissed Sam. Numerous other
kisses and handshakes followed, and for the time
being Sam and Grace were the happiest young
people in the world.</p>

<p>"Let us send telegrams home, announcing the
affair," suggested the youngest Rover, after the
meal was at an end. "I know dad, as well as
Aunt Martha and Uncle Randolph, will be glad
to hear of it."</p>

<p>The telegrams were quickly prepared and sent
off. In the messages Sam notified those at home
where the touring party would be for the next
ten days.</p>

<p>After that several days slipped by quickly.
The tourists had covered a good many miles
and were now approaching the Mississippi
River. The weather had been ideal, and not a
single puncture or blowout had come to cause
them trouble. Sam and Grace were much together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and, as the youngest Rover declared,
"were having the time of their lives."</p>

<p>"It's queer I don't get more word from New
York," remarked Dick one evening, when they
had reached a city which I shall call Pemberton.
"Dad acknowledged that telegram of Sam's, but
he didn't say a word about that Lansing deal or
anything about the Bruno bonds."</p>

<p>"Well, let us hope that no news is good news,"
returned Tom. "Anyway, I'm not going to
worry until I know there is something to worry
about."</p>

<p>That evening came word from Valley Brook,
stating that everything was going along well at
the farm and that Mr. Anderson Rover was confining
himself closely to business in New York.</p>

<p>The Mississippi was crossed, and then the tourists
headed in the direction of Colorado Springs.
It was their intention to make the Springs the
turning point of the trip, with a side trip by the
cog railway to Pike's Peak. They would return
by the way of Denver. Some days later found
them in Topeka, where they had decided to rest
up for a day or two. During that time only one
short telegram had come from Mr. Anderson
Rover, stating that the Bruno bonds had been
sold at a fair profit, but that the Lansing deal was
still uncertain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"We stand to win or lose quite a lot of money
on that Lansing deal," Dick explained to Sam.
"It's rather a peculiar affair. The whole thing
is being engineered by a Wall Street syndicate."</p>

<p>On the morning of the second day in Topeka,
when Sam and Grace and some of the others
had gone shopping, Dick heard one of the bellboys
call his name.</p>

<p>"Telegram," he said to Tom. "I hope this is
from dad and that it contains good news."</p>

<p>The telegram proved to be what is known as
a Night Letter, and its contents caused the two
Rovers much astonishment. The communication
ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Have been following up the Lansing deal
closely. Affairs are getting rather clouded and I
am afraid we may lose out. A new opposition
has appeared, a combination headed by your former
friend, Waltham. He is still in the West
but his agents are working against us. He has
also bought controlling interest in the Haverford
deal. Evidently means to hit us as hard as
possible. Will know more in a day or two and
will let you know at once of any change in affairs.</p>

<div style="text-align: right;">

<h3>CLOUDBURST AND FLOOD</h3>


<p>"I see it!" cried Tom. "That's the spoke Chester
Waltham told Sam he would put in our
wheel."</p>

<p>"I guess you are right," returned his older
brother. "Evidently Waltham is a meaner fellow
than I took him to be. Just because Grace would
not put up with his ungentlemanly attentions he
evidently is going to do what he can to make
trouble for us."</p>

<p>"I don't understand what dad means by the
Haverford deal," went on Tom, as he studied the
telegram. "I thought that deal was closed long
ago."</p>

<p>"They thought of closing it, Tom, but at the
last moment something went wrong and the men
who were going into the matter withdrew. That
put a large part of the burden on our shoulders.
We have at least forty thousand dollars invested
in it. Now, if Waltham has bought a controlling
interest, as dad says, he will be able to swing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
any way he pleases, just as he may be able to
swing the Lansing deal, too."</p>

<p>"How much money have we got locked up in
that? The last I heard it was only about eight
thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"When I left, dad said he expected to put in
another twelve thousand, which would make a
total of twenty thousand dollars, Tom."</p>

<p>"Phew! Then that makes a grand total of
sixty thousand dollars in the two deals. Chester
Waltham must have a lot of loose money, if
he can jump into deals as big as those are at a
moment's notice."</p>

<p>"Oh, a young millionaire like Waltham can get
hold of cash whenever he wants it," answered
Dick. He ran his hand through his hair thoughtfully.
"This looks bad to me. Perhaps I had
better take a train back to New York without
delay."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you did that it would spoil the trip for
Dora," protested his brother.</p>

<p>"It's better to spoil the trip than to let Chester
Waltham get the better of us."</p>

<p>"Why not send a telegram asking if it will do
any good for you to come home?" questioned
Tom. And after a little discussion Dick decided
to do this, and the telegram was sent without
delay. A few hours later word came back that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
if Dick was needed his father would send for him.</p>

<p>The stay in Topeka was extended to the best
part of a week, for that night a furious rainstorm
set in which lasted two days. The downpour was
unusually heavy, and as a consequence many of
the outlying roads became well-nigh impassable.</p>

<p>During the last day of the storm Sam received
a long letter from Songbird in which the would-be
poet told of how he was working to make his
way in the world and also earn some money that
he might pay back the amount lost by Mr. Sanderson.
He added that so far the authorities had
been unable to find any further trace of Blackie
Crowden.</p>

<p>"It's too bad!" was Sam's comment, after he
had read this communication. "Poor Songbird!
I suppose he feels as bad as ever over the loss of
that money."</p>

<p>At last the sun once more broke through the
clouds and the journey of the tourists was resumed.
Close to the city the roads were in fairly
good condition, but farther out they soon found
evidences of the tremendous downpour of the
days before. Deep gullies had been cut here
and there, and occasionally they came across
washed-out trees and brushwood.</p>

<p>"We'll have to take it a bit slowly, especially
after dark," remarked Dick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>When they passed over some of the rivers they
found the rushing waters reached almost to the
flooring of the bridges; and on the second day
out they found one bridge swept completely away,
so that they had to make a detour of many miles
to gain another crossing.</p>

<p>"What a tremendous loss to some of these
farmers," remarked Mrs. Laning, as they rolled
past numerous cornfields where the stalks had
been swept down and covered with mud. "I am
glad to say we never had anything like this at
Cedarville."</p>

<p>"And we never had anything like it at Valley
Brook either," returned Dick. "This is the
worst washout I ever saw."</p>

<p>At noon they stopped at a small town for dinner
and there they heard numerous reports concerning
the storm. In one place it had taken away
a barn and a cowshed and in another it had
undermined the foundations of several houses.</p>

<p>"The water up to Hickyville was three feet
deep in the street," said one man at the hotel.
"The folks had to rescue people by boats and
rafts. One man had four cows drowned, and up
at Ganey Point a man lost all his pigs and two
horses."</p>

<p>The party had scarcely left that town when it
began to rain again. The downpour, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
was for a time so light that they did not think it
worth while to stop or to turn back.</p>

<p>"We'll put the tops up," said Tom, "and maybe
in a little while the clouds will blow away."</p>

<p>But Tom's hopes were doomed to disappointment.
The downpour was comparatively light for
about an hour, but then, just as they were passing
through a patch of timber, it suddenly came on
with great fury.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" burst out Sam, as a gust of
wind drove the rain under the automobile tops.
"We'll have to put down the side curtains."</p>

<p>"Right you are!" answered Dick; and then the
machines were halted and all the curtains were
lowered and fastened. But even this did not
protect them entirely, for the wind drove the rain
in between the numerous cracks of the covering.</p>

<p>"How many miles to the next stopping place?"
queried Nellie.</p>

<p>"About thirty," answered Tom. "That is, if
we go as far as we calculated to when we left this
morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't see how we are going to make
thirty miles more in such a storm as this!" cried
her sister.</p>

<p>"We'll be lucky to make any kind of stopping
place," announced Dick, grimly. "Just listen to
that!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a wild roaring of wind outside, and
then came a flash of lightning followed by a deafening
clap of thunder.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" came in a shriek from the girls;
and involuntarily they placed their hands to their
ears.</p>

<p>"Richard, do you think it is safe to stay under
the trees in such a storm as this?" questioned
Mrs. Stanhope, fearfully.</p>

<p>Before Dick could reply to this question there
came more lightning and thunder, and then a
crash in the woods as a big tree was laid low.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Listen!" cried Nellie. "Suppose
one of the trees should come down on the autos!"</p>

<p>"That is what I was afraid of," added her
mother. "I think we had better get out of here."</p>

<p>"All right, if you say so," answered Dick. "I
was only thinking about the awful wind. It's
going to hit us pretty hard when we get out on
the open road."</p>

<p>The automobiles had drawn up side by side, so
that those in one machine could converse with
those in the other. Now Dick started up one
of the touring cars and was followed a minute
later by Tom, at the wheel of the other automobile.</p>

<p>Once in the open air, those in the machines realized
how furiously the wind was blowing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
how heavily the rain was descending. The automobiles
fairly shook and shivered in the blasts,
and despite their efforts to keep themselves dry
all those in the automobiles were speedily
drenched. The downpour was so heavy that the
landscape on all sides was completely blotted out.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick! what in the world shall we do?"
gasped Dora, and it was plainly to be seen that
she was badly frightened.</p>

<p>"I'd turn in somewhere if I only knew where,"
answered her husband, trying his best to peer
through the rain-spattered wind-shield. "I don't
see anything like a house anywhere around, do
you?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't see a thing."</p>

<p>Dick was running along cautiously, and now,
of a sudden, he put on the brakes. Just ahead of
him had appeared a flood of water, and how deep
it was there was no telling.</p>

<p>"Listen!" cried Mrs. Stanhope, when the automobile
had come to a standstill. "Did I hear
somebody calling?"</p>

<p>Scarcely had she spoken when there came another
vivid flash of lightning followed by more
thunder, and then a downpour heavier than ever.
As the lightning flashed out Dick was surprised
to see a girl splashing through the water on the
road and running toward them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look! Look!" he ejaculated. "Unless I am
mistaken it's Ada Waltham!"</p>

<p>"It is! It is!" exclaimed Dora. "What in the
world is she doing out alone in such a downpour
as this!"</p>

<p>As the girl on the road came closer to the touring
car Dick threw up one of the curtains, opened
the door, and sprang out to meet her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Rover!" gasped Ada Waltham, "is
it really you? How fortunate! Won't you please
help me?"</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" he demanded quickly.</p>

<p>"Chester! He's lost!"</p>

<p>"Lost! Where?"</p>

<p>"He tried to cross the river yonder in the
storm, and the bridge broke and let the automobile
down. I managed to save myself and jumped
ashore, but he was carried off by the torrent."
The rich girl clasped her hands nervously. "Oh,
please save him, Mr. Rover! Please do!"</p>

<p>By this time the second automobile had come
up, and Dick waved to Tom to stop. Seeing that
something was wrong, Tom quickly alighted,
followed by Sam.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" came from both of the new
arrivals, as they gazed at Ada Waltham in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Miss Waltham says her brother is lost&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
he has been carried off in the flood of yonder
river," answered Dick.</p>

<p>"Oh, please hurry!" burst out the girl eagerly.
"Please hurry, or it will be too late! I don't think
Chester can swim."</p>

<p>"All right, we'll tell the others where we are
going and then we'll do what we can," answered
Dick. "But if that flood is very strong we may
have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dick was unable to finish his speech. Just then
there came more lightning followed by a deafening
crash of thunder. Then the very heavens
seemed to open, to let down a torrent of water
which seemed to fairly engulf them.</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!" came from the women and
the girls. "Oh! what a terrible storm!"</p>

<p>"It is a cloudburst! That's what it is!" gasped
Sam.</p>

<p>"You're right!" ejaculated Tom. "Look! See
how the water in the river is rising! It's a cloudburst
and a flood!"</p>

<p>Tom was right&mdash;there had been a cloudburst,
but fortunately not directly over the heads of our
friends, otherwise they might have perished in
the terrible downpour which immediately followed.
The catastrophe had occurred at a point
about a mile farther up the river, and now the
waters from this flood were coming down with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
great swiftness and rising higher and higher every
instant.</p>

<p>"We've got to get out of here," was Sam's
comment. Already they were standing in water
up to their ankles. "We've got to find higher
ground."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam! Sam! please don't let my brother
drown!" pleaded Ada Waltham, catching him by
the arm.</p>

<p>"We'll do what we can to save him, Ada, but
we've got to save ourselves first," he answered.</p>

<p>"See! there is a little hill ahead," came from
Dick, as he did his best to look through the rain,
which was coming down as heavily as ever. "Let
us run to the top of the rise, then we'll be in less
danger from the flood if the river gets much
higher." He turned to the distracted girl.
"Come, you had better go with us, then we will
see what we can do for your brother."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dick! Dick! If you don't hurry we'll
be swept away, sure!" cried Dora, and then made
room so that Ada might get in beside her.</p>

<p>In a moment more the three Rovers had re-entered
the touring cars, and then the machines
were sent forward through the water, which was
now nearly a foot deep on the roadway.</p>

<p>"Oh! I never saw such a storm in my life,"
was Mrs. Laning's comment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"If only we get out of this alive!" breathed
Mrs. Stanhope. Being naturally a very nervous
woman, she was on the verge of a collapse.</p>

<p>Running with care through the swirling water
that covered the roadway, they at length reached
a rise of ground several feet above the flood.
Here they stopped at the highest point they
could gain, bringing the machines side by side.</p>

<p>When the storm had started in earnest the
three Rovers had donned their raincoats. Now,
with rain caps pulled well down over their heads,
they once more alighted.</p>

<p>"If you can show us where your auto went
into the river we'll see if we can locate your
brother," announced Dick to Ada Waltham.
"Maybe he got out and is walking somewhere
around here," he added, by way of encouragement.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I'm so nervous I can scarcely
stand!" gasped the girl, and when she reached the
ground they had to support her.</p>

<p>Splashing along through the water that covered
the roadway, they slowly progressed until
they gained a point where the youths felt it would
be impossible for Ada Waltham to go any farther.</p>

<p>"There is what is left of the bridge over yonder,"
cried the girl, pointing with her hand.</p>

<p>The Rovers looked in that direction and saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
a few sticks of timber sticking out of the swirling
waters, which were running down stream as turbulently
as ever.</p>

<p>"I don't think there is any use of looking for
Chester around that bridge," was Tom's remark.
"Most likely he was carried down stream&mdash;how
far there is no telling. I think the best thing we
can do is to take a look farther down."</p>

<p>"That is just my opinion," returned his older
brother. "I think you had better return to the
autos. It won't do any good for you to remain
out in this storm," he continued to the girl.</p>

<p>When the party got back to the cars they found
a farmer and his grown son standing by the
machines.</p>

<p>"I was just telling the ladies you had better
run your automobiles up to my place," said the
farmer. "It's about ten or fifteen feet higher
than this, and, consequently, just so much safer.
Besides, the ladies can come into the house."</p>

<p>"We want to find this young lady's brother.
He was swept off the bridge yonder," returned
Dick.</p>

<p>"So the ladies were telling me," returned James
Barlow. "You come up to the house, and I'll go
out with you. We've got a big rowboat that may
come in handy. Say! ain't this some storm?
Worst let-down I've ever seen in these parts."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>THE RESCUE ON THE RIVER</h3>


<p>It did not take long to run the automobiles
down the road and up a side lane leading to the
farmer's house. Here the ladies got out, and
then the machines were placed in a barn.</p>

<p>"You will do all you can to find my brother?"
wailed Ada Waltham, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, we'll do our level best," answered Dick;
and Tom and Sam said practically the same.</p>

<p>The Rovers consulted with Mr. Barlow and his
son, James, and all five walked down as close to
the edge of the river as the effects of the cloudburst
would allow. They saw bushes, trees, and
parts of buildings coming down the swiftly-flowing
stream, the waters of which were now
thick with mud.</p>

<p>"Here is my rowboat," announced the farmer,
pointing to where the craft was tied fast to a
large tree. "You can use it if you want to, but
it looks to me like rather a hopeless matter to try
to do anything while the river is raging like this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
You had better wait until it calms down a little."</p>

<p>"The trouble of it is, it may then be too late,"
answered Tom. He looked at his brothers. "I
think we can manage it," he added.</p>

<p>The matter was discussed for fully a quarter
of an hour, and during that time the storm seemed
to let up a little. The first awful effects of the
cloudburst were passing, and the water was going
down slowly but surely.</p>

<p>"We'll try it," announced Dick, at last. "If
we can't manage the rowboat we'll come ashore
farther down the stream."</p>

<p>The craft was a substantial one, and there were
two pairs of oars, and to these James Barlow
added a sweep to be used as a rudder. Then
the three Rovers embarked, Tom and Sam to do
the rowing and the other brother to guide the
craft. It was hard, dangerous work, as they
realized as soon as they struck the current of
the swollen stream. They were sent along pell-mell,
and it was all they could do to keep themselves
from crashing into one object or another on
the way.</p>

<p>"Look out, or you'll get upset!" yelled James
Barlow to them, and then his voice was drowned
out in the rushing and roaring of the elements
around them.</p>

<p>A half hour passed&mdash;which to the Rovers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
just then seemed almost an age. During that time
the three kept their eyes wide open for a possible
sight of Chester Waltham or anybody else who
might have been carried away by the flood.</p>

<p>"There is somebody!" suddenly called out
Dick. "A man caught in a tree!"</p>

<p>"Is it Waltham?" demanded Tom, quickly.</p>

<p>"I can't make out. He is crouched in a heap
on some limbs and is waving frantically for us."</p>

<p>Not without additional peril did the Rovers
turn the rowboat across the river, for the tree in
which the man was crouching was on the shore
opposite to that from which they had embarked.</p>

<p>"Hello! there are two fellows in the tree!"
announced Tom, as they drew closer.</p>

<p>The second man crouched behind the trunk, so
that they had not at first been able to see him.</p>

<p>"Help! Help!" came from the fellow who
had been waving so frantically to them. And
now, as they drew still closer, they saw that the
individual was Chester Waltham. The young
millionaire was capless and coatless, and his face
and hands were much scratched.</p>

<p>"We're in luck, that's sure," was Tom's comment,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"And I'm glad on his sister's account," added
Sam.</p>

<p>"When we bring the boat up beside the tree you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
lower yourself into it, Waltham," directed Dick.
"But be careful how you do it or we'll upset.
The current here is very swift."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I'll be careful," answered the young
millionaire in a voice which trembled so that he
could scarcely speak. He was, of course, much
surprised to discover that it was the Rovers who
had come to his assistance.</p>

<p>He was so exhausted that to get out of the tree
in safety was all but impossible, and finally Dick
had to assist him while Tom and Sam did all
they could to hold the rowboat in position.</p>

<p>"It's fine of you to come for me!" panted Chester
Waltham, when he found himself safe in the
rowboat. "Di-did my si-sister get you, or what?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she escaped and told us of your plight,"
answered Dick, briefly.</p>

<p>"Good for Ada! Now get me safe on shore
once more and I'll pay you handsomely for your
trouble."</p>

<p>"You won't have to pay us a cent, Waltham,"
was Sam's quick reply. "Just sit still so that the
boat doesn't go over."</p>

<p>"Can I help you in any way?"</p>

<p>"No. Sit still, that's all," came from Tom,
sharply. The idea of having Waltham speak of
paying them at such a time disgusted him.</p>

<p>In the meantime the second fellow in the tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
had moved down a limb or two with the idea of
following Waltham into the rowboat. But now,
as he looked at the three Rovers, he suddenly
drew back.</p>

<p>"Hi there! don't you want to come with us?"
cried Dick, considerably astonished over the man's
actions.</p>

<p>To this the individual in the tree made no reply.
He kept behind the trunk and finally waved a
hand as if to motion them away.</p>

<p>"Say! is that fellow crazy?" questioned Sam.</p>

<p>"He must be," was Tom's comment. He turned
to Chester Waltham. "Do you know him!"</p>

<p>"No, he's a stranger to me. I tried to speak
to him, but he was so scared and cold from the
ducking he got he did nothing but chatter, so I
couldn't understand him."</p>

<p>"See here, it's foolish to stay up there," called
out Dick. "Come on down and we'll take you
ashore."</p>

<p>"D-do-don't want to g-g-go," came the stuttered-out
reply. "G-go-wheep!" came in a funny
little whistle. "G-g-go a-away!"</p>

<p>"Well, of all the scared fellows&mdash;&mdash;" commenced
Tom.</p>

<p>"Great Scott! I wonder if that fellow can be
Blackie Crowden!" ejaculated Sam.</p>

<p>"G-g-go a-wa-way!" stuttered the man in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
tree, and then tried to say something more, but
the words only ended in a strange little whistle.</p>

<p>"Sam, do you really think it can be the fellow
who robbed Songbird?" demanded Dick. "What
would he be doing away out here?"</p>

<p>"Why, Blackie Crowden came from Denver
or Colorado Springs," announced the youngest
Rover. "Remember, we are not so many miles
away from those places." He raised his voice.
"You come down out of there, Crowden. We
know you and we want you."</p>

<p>At this command the man in the tree seemed
much disturbed. He tried to speak, but because
of his natural stutter and his terror of the situation
through which he was passing, his effort was
a failure.</p>

<p>"If you don't come down, we'll haul you
down," ordered Dick, finally, and then, after a
little more urging, the fellow finally consented to
come out of the tree, and dropped into the rowboat.</p>

<p>"Blackie Crowden, as sure as fate!" murmured
Sam, as soon as he got a good look at the fellow's
features. "Well, if this isn't luck!"</p>

<p>"Evidently you know this fellow," came from
Chester Waltham, curiously.</p>

<p>"We sure do!" declared Sam. "He's the man
who knocked our college chum, John Powell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
down on the road near Ashton and robbed him
of four thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"I di-didn't r-r-rob any bo-body," stuttered
Blackie Crowden. "It's all a mi-mis-mis-mista-ta-take!"
and he ended with his usual queer whistle.</p>

<p>"We'll see about that later, Crowden," put in
Dick, sternly. "Now you sit perfectly still or
else maybe you'll go overboard and be drowned."</p>

<p>It would be difficult to describe the joy with
which Ada Waltham greeted her brother on his
safe return. She flew into his arms and, as wet
as he was, hugged him over and over again.</p>

<p>"Oh! I was so afraid you'd be drowned,
Chester!" and then she added quickly: "How
grand it was for the Rovers to go to your assistance!"</p>

<p>"It certainly was very fine of them to do it,"
returned the young millionaire. And now it must
be admitted that he seemed very much disturbed
in mind. "I'm going to pay them back, you see
if I don't," he added, after a thoughtful pause.</p>

<p>Blackie Crowden had done his best to make
them believe that he was not guilty of the attack
upon Songbird, but the Rovers would not listen
to this, and put him through such a grilling that
finally he broke down and confessed all.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have done the deed at all if it
hadn't been that I was worried over another matter,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
he said amid much stuttering and whistling.
"I ain't a bad man naturally, even though I do
drink and gamble a little. If it hadn't been for
a lawyer named Belright Fogg I would never have
robbed the young man."</p>

<p>"Belright Fogg!" came from the Rovers.</p>

<p>"What has that shyster lawyer to do with it?"
added Sam.</p>

<p>"Do you know he is a shyster lawyer?"</p>

<p>"We sure do!" added Tom, promptly.</p>

<p>"Then you will understand me when I tell you
how it was. Some time ago I was mixed up in a
land transaction. It is a long story, and all I
need to tell you is that Belright Fogg was in it,
too. I did some things that I oughtn't to, and
that gave Fogg a hold on me. Finally he claimed
that I owed him three hundred dollars, and he
said if I didn't pay up he would make it hot for
me and maybe land me in jail. That got me
scared and I said I'd get the money somehow.</p>

<p>"Then by accident I saw Powell get the money
from the bank, and I followed him on horseback,
passed him, and took the cash, as you know.
As soon as the deed was done I was sorry for it,
but then it was too late," stuttered Blackie Crowden,
and hung his head.</p>

<p>"And did you go to Belright Fogg and give
him the three hundred dollars?" queried Sam.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. I met him in Leadenfield, at a road
house kept by a Frenchman named Bissette."</p>

<p>"Then I was right after all!" cried Sam. "I
accused Fogg of meeting you, but he denied it."</p>

<p>"Well, he got the three hundred all right
enough," stuttered Crowden.</p>

<p>"And how was it you tried to keep out of our
sight in that flood?" asked Sam curiously. "Did
you know us?"</p>

<p>"I knew you&mdash;saw you follow me to the depot
at Dentonville. You thought I got on that train.
But I didn't&mdash;I took a night freight."</p>

<p>"I see. That is why the authorities didn't spot
you."</p>

<p>"That's it. But you were asking about Fogg,"
continued Blackie Crowden, speculatively.</p>

<p>"And did he know you had stolen the money?"
demanded Dick, sharply.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure he did, although he didn't
ask any questions. He knew about the robbery,
and he knew well enough that I didn't have any
three hundred dollars of my own to give him."</p>

<p>"What did you do with the rest of the money,
Crowden? I hope you didn't spend it?" questioned
Sam, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Spend it!" came in a bitter stutter from the
criminal. "I didn't get any chance to spend it.
All I had was two hundred dollars!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then what became of the other thirty-five
hundred?" questioned Tom.</p>

<p>"It's in a room at the Ashton hotel, unless somebody
found it and stole it."</p>

<p>"At the Ashton hotel!" cried Sam.</p>

<p>"That's it. You see, after I met Fogg I
stopped at Ashton for one night and put up at
the old hotel on the Cheesley turnpike. I hid
the money in an out-of-the-way corner of a
clothes closet, because I didn't want to carry it
on my person. Then, when I was on the street,
I heard that you were on my trail, and I got
scared and I was afraid to go back to the hotel
to get it."</p>

<p>"Can you remember what room it was?"
queried Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was a back room&mdash;number twenty-two.
I put the money in a hole in the wall back
of an upper shelf."</p>

<p>"We had better notify the authorities at Ashton
of this," said Tom to his brothers.</p>

<p>"Let us telegraph to Songbird and tell him to
go to Ashton," suggested Sam. "If the money
is there, Songbird ought to have the fun of getting
it and returning it to Mr. Sanderson."</p>

<p>"All right, let's do it!" cried Dick; and so the
matter was arranged.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h3>MRS. SAM ROVER&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>"Well, that's good news and I'm mighty glad
to hear it."</p>

<p>It was Dick who spoke, three days after the
incidents recorded in the last chapter. Our
friends had been staying at the farmhouse of Mr.
Barlow. Blackie Crowden had been turned over
to the local authorities, the oldest Rover making
the charge against him. Crowden had pleaded
for mercy, but the boys, while sympathizing with
him, had thought it best to let the law take its
course. Chester Waltham and his sister had also
remained at the farmhouse, which fortunately
was a large one, so that the whole party was not
particularly crowded for room.</p>

<p>The rescue of the young millionaire from the
river had worked wonders, and he was now heartily
ashamed of himself, not only for the way he
had treated Grace but also on account of the instructions
he had sent to his agents in Wall Street.</p>

<p>"You can rest assured, Mr. Rover, that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
opposition to your plans in New York will be
withdrawn," he said to Dick. "I am going to
telegraph to my agents as soon as I get a chance.
And I want you and your brothers to understand
that I appreciate thoroughly your goodness in
coming to my rescue. It was a splendid thing to
do. I am not going to insult you by offering you
any reward&mdash;all I can say is that I thank you
from the bottom of my heart." And that evening
Chester Waltham and his sister had taken their
departure, stating that the accident at the bridge
had ended their idea of touring farther, and that
they were going to take the first train they could
get for the East.</p>

<p>The thing that Dick called "good news" was
a long "Night Letter" sent over the wires by
Songbird. The former poet of Brill had received
their message concerning Blackie Crowden, and
also Belright Fogg, and had at once hurried to
Ashton and to the hotel on the Cheesley turnpike.
There, in room twenty-two, as mentioned
by Crowden, he had found the package containing
the thirty-five hundred dollars. Next he had
called on Belright Fogg and had scared the shyster
lawyer so completely that Fogg had returned
the three hundred dollars received from Crowden
with scarcely a protest. Then the happy youth
had driven over to the Sanderson place. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Sandersons had been surprised to see him and
amazed to learn that he had recovered so large a
portion of the stolen money.</p>

<blockquote><p>"As I had already paid Mr. Sanderson one hundred
dollars," wrote Songbird, "it made a total
of thirty-nine hundred returned to him, and he
told me that I need not bother about the other
hundred. But I paid it just the same, for I had
just been fortunate enough to sell six of my
poems&mdash;two to a magazine and four to a weekly
paper&mdash;for one hundred and sixty dollars.</p>

<p>"Of course we had a grand time, and Mr.
Sanderson has forgiven everything. He and
Minnie think you are mighty smart fellows, and
I agree with them. Minnie and I have fixed matters
all up between us, and we are the happiest
couple you ever saw. I don't know how to thank
you enough for what you have done for me, and
all I can add is, God bless you, every one!"</p></blockquote>

<p>"Good old Songbird!" murmured Sam, as he
read the communication a second time. "I'll
wager he feels a hundred per cent. better than
he did."</p>

<p>"And to think he sold six of his poems!" commented
Tom. "I shouldn't wonder if he thinks
more of that than he does of getting the money
back," he added, somewhat drily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following day came another telegram,
this time from Mr. Rover, stating that the opposition
of the Waltham interests in Wall Street
had been suddenly withdrawn. But he added
that business matters in the metropolis were becoming
more and more arduous for him, and he
asked when Dick expected to get back.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's getting too much for dear, old
dad," was Dick's comment, on perusing this message.
"I think the best thing I can do is to get
back and help him."</p>

<p>"Well, if you go back, I think I'll go back myself,"
said Tom. "Anyway, this tour seems to
have come to a standstill, with so much rain."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to go back if you fellows say so,"
put in Sam.</p>

<p>"I'll wager he and Grace want to get ready for
their wedding," remarked Tom, slily.</p>

<p>"That's just what we do," returned Sam,
boldly. "We're going to be married early this
fall, aren't we, Grace?" and he gazed fondly at
the girl, who nodded, and then turned away to
hide her blushes.</p>

<p>But the tour did not come to an end as quickly
as might have been expected. On the day following
it was such fair weather that they left the
Barlow farm and started once more on their trip
westward. Colorado Springs was soon gained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and, passing on to Manitou, they left the automobiles,
and took the cog railway to the summit of
Pike's Peak. Then, on the day following, they
motored up to Denver.</p>

<p>"We can ship our automobiles home by
freight," said Dick, "and by returning by train
we can be back in New York in no time."</p>

<p>A week later found the entire party once
more in the East. While Dick and Tom settled
down to help their father at the offices in Wall
Street, the others returned to Valley Brook and
to Cedarville, to prepare for the coming wedding.</p>

<p>"And where is it to be, Sam?" questioned Tom,
when the brothers were on the point of parting.</p>

<p>"Oh, it can only be in one place," was Sam's
answer.</p>

<p>"And I guess I know where that is," returned
Tom, with a grin.</p>

<p>Both Dick and Tom had been married in the
Cedarville Union Church, a little stone edifice
covered with ivy, which was located not a great
distance from the homes of the Lanings and the
Stanhopes, and also Putnam Hall. As before, it
was a question if the numerous guests who were
expected to the ceremony would be able to get
into the building. But both Grace and Sam said
they would have to make the best of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the wedding invitations were issued,
the presents began to come in, and they were fully
as numerous and as costly as had been the gifts
bestowed upon Dora and upon Nellie. From Mr.
Rover came, as was to be expected, a bankbook
containing an amount written therein which was
the duplicate of that he had bestowed upon Dick
and Dora and likewise upon Tom and Nellie.</p>

<p>"You can always depend on dad," was Sam's
comment, his voice choking a little. "The best
dad anybody ever had!"</p>

<p>"Indeed you are right!" answered the bride-to-be.
"And I'm going to love him just as if he
were my own father."</p>

<p>Sam's own present to his bride was a gold
wrist-watch set in diamonds and pearls&mdash;a beautiful
affair over which the happy girl went wild
with delight.</p>

<p>At last came the eventful day, full of golden
sunshine. All of the Rovers had arrived in
Cedarville and were quartered at the hotel. Many
other guests were at the Stanhope homestead and
at the Laning farm, and still others&mdash;former
cadets&mdash;had come back not only to attend the
wedding but also to take another look at dear old
Putnam Hall.</p>

<p>Among the old guard who had thus presented
themselves were Fred Garrison, Larry Colby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
Bart Conners and Harry Blossom. Among those
who had attended Brill were Stanley Browne,
Spud Jackson, Bob Grimes and, of course, Songbird.</p>

<p>"I'm engaged to Minnie," whispered the latter
to the Rovers at the first opportunity. "We are
going to be married just as soon as my income
will permit. And what do you think? I've sold
four more poems&mdash;got eighty dollars for them,"
and his face beamed as they had never seen it
shine before.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Songbird," returned Sam,
heartily. "I certainly hope you get to be the
best-known poet in the United States."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about that. I am going
to buckle down to business. My uncle thinks I
am doing wonderfully well, and he says if I keep
on he is going to give me a substantial increase
in salary after the first of the year. I'm going
to write verses just as a side issue."</p>

<p>As at the other weddings, the ceremony was
set for high noon. Soon the guests began to arrive,
and before long the old church was crowded
to its capacity, with many standing up in the
aisles and in the rear and even at the side windows,
which were wide open.</p>

<p>Captain Putnam, in full uniform and looking
a little grayer than ever, was there, and with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
George Strong, his head assistant, with whom
Sam had always been very friendly. There were
also numerous girls there who had formerly attended
Hope Seminary, and of these one was a
flower girl and two were bridesmaids.</p>

<p>Sam's best man was his old Putnam Hall chum,
Fred Garrison, while among the ushers were
Songbird, Stanley, Spud, Bob, and some others
of his former classmates.</p>

<p>Presently the organ pealed out and the minister
appeared, followed a moment later by Sam. Then
up the aisle came Grace on the arm of Mr. Laning,
and daintily attired in white with a flowing
veil beset with orange blossoms.</p>

<p>"Oh, how pretty she looks!" said more than
one; and they spoke the truth, for Grace certainly
made a beautiful bride.</p>

<p>The ceremony was a brief but solemn one, and
then, as the organ pealed out joyously, the happy
pair walked forth from the church, to enter an
automobile which whirled them off to the Laning
homestead. To that place they were followed by
a great number of invited guests. An elaborate
wedding dinner had been prepared, and an orchestra
from the city had been hired, and all sat
down to a feast of good things with music.</p>

<p>"We'll have to give them a send-off&mdash;same as
they gave me," said Tom to his brother Dick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
while the festivities were at their height. "They'll
be getting ready to go away soon."</p>

<p>"Sure! we'll give them a send-off," returned
the oldest brother. "Come on, let us get busy."</p>

<p>Down at the barns an automobile was in readiness
to take Sam and his bride away on their
wedding trip. This car Dick and Tom and a
number of others lost no time in decorating with
white streamers and a placard which read: <i>We
are on our wedding trip. Congratulate us.</i></p>

<p>"Aren't you going to stay to have a dance?"
questioned Nellie of her sister, a little later.</p>

<p>"Of course," answered Grace; and shortly after
that she and Sam tripped around to the tuneful
measures of a two-step. All of the young folks
present joined in, the older folks looking on with
much satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I can hardly believe it," declared old Aunt
Martha, as she took off her spectacles to wipe her
eyes. "Why, it don't seem no time since Sam was
just a baby!"</p>

<p>The dancing continued for some time but then,
of a sudden, came a cry from Dora:</p>

<p>"Where are Sam and Grace? I don't see them
anywhere."</p>

<p>"They are gone! They have given us the slip!"</p>

<p>"No, they've gone upstairs. Wait here, and
we'll give them a shower."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>The young folks gathered in the hallway and
out on the piazza, and a few minutes later Sam
and Grace appeared, both ready for their tour.
Then came a grand shower of rice and confetti,
mingled with two or three old shoes, and in the
midst of this the happy, laughing young couple
escaped to the automobile which was now drawn
up before the door. The chauffeur was ready for
the start, and in an instant more the machine
shot down the lane and out into the roadway.</p>

<p>"Good-bye! Good-bye and good luck to you!"
was the cry.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, everybody!" came back from the
touring car, and Sam and Grace stood up to wave
their hands to those left behind. Then the touring
car disappeared around a turn of the road,
and they were gone.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>And now let me add a few words more and
thus bring to a close this long series of adventures
in which the three Rover boys, Dick, Tom, and
Sam, have played such an important part.</p>

<p>A number of years have passed and many
changes of importance have occurred. Mr. Anderson
Rover has retired from active participation
in The Rover Company, and Dick is now the
president, with Tom secretary and Sam treasurer.
The concern is doing remarkably well and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
all of the Rovers are reported to be wealthy. The
father has returned to the farm at Valley Brook,
where he lives in peace and comfort with Uncle
Randolph and Aunt Martha, who, despite their
years, are still in the best of health.</p>

<p>A year after Sam's marriage to Grace, Songbird
Powell married Minnie Sanderson. The
would-be poet has made quite a business man of
himself and, what perhaps is of even greater
pleasure to himself, has had many of his poems
accepted by our leading periodicals.</p>

<p>When Sam was first married he went to live in
an apartment close to those occupied by Dick and
Tom, but two years later the three brothers had
a chance to buy a beautiful plot of ground on
Riverside Drive, facing the noble Hudson River,
and on this they built three beautiful houses adjoining
one another.</p>

<p>"I guess we are in New York to stay," was the
way the oldest brother had expressed himself,
"and if that is so we may as well make ourselves
as comfortable here as possible."</p>

<p>Before the young folks moved into the new
homes Dick and Dora were blessed with a little
son, who later on was named John after Mr.
John Laning. Little Jack, as he was always called
by the others, was a wonderfully bright and clever
lad and a great source of comfort to his parents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Later still the young couple had a daughter, whom
they named Martha after Dick's aunt.</p>

<p>Tom and Nellie had twin boys that were
speedily christened Andy after Mr. Anderson
Rover, and Randy after Tom's Uncle Randolph.
Then Sam came along with a daughter, who was
called Mary after Mrs. Laning and with a son,
whom he called Fred after his old school chum,
Fred Garrison.</p>

<p>The young Rover boys had a great many
qualities similar to those displayed by their fathers.
Little Jack was as strong and sturdy as
Dick had ever been, and young Fred had many
of the peculiarities of Sam, while Andy and
Randy, the twins, were the equal of their father,
Tom, for creating fun.</p>

<p>"I don't know what we're ever going to do
with those kids," remarked Tom, one day, after
Andy and Randy had played a big joke on Jack
and Fred. "Some day they'll pull the house
down over our ears."</p>

<p>"Well, Andy and Randy are simply chips of the
old block," laughed Dick Rover. "I suppose we'll
all have to do as our folks did with us&mdash;send the
lads off to some strict boarding school."</p>

<p>"If I ever do send them off, I know where it
will be," answered Tom Rover. "Our old Putnam
Hall chum, Larry Colby, has opened a first-class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
military academy which he calls Colby Hall.
If I ever send them away I think I'll send them
to Larry."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't be a half bad idea," put in Sam
Rover. "Larry was always a first-class fellow
and I don't doubt but what he is running a first-class
school."</p>

<p>"Well, those boys are too young yet to leave
home," was Dick Rover's comment. "If they are
to go to boarding school that must come later."</p>

<p>A few years after that Jack, Andy and Randy,
and Fred were sent to Colby Hall, and it is possible
that some day I may tell you of what happened
there to this younger generation of Rovers.</p>

<p>Dick, Tom, and Sam were happy, and with
good reason. They had the best of wives, and
children that they dearly loved, and though they
worked hard they were surrounded with every
comfort. Every summer, and at Christmas time,
they left New York either for Valley Brook or
for Cedarville, there to receive the warmest of
welcomes. Life looked rosy to all of them, and
here we will leave them and say good-bye.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
